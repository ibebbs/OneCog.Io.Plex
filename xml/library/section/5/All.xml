  <Directory ratingKey="60596" key="/library/metadata/60596/children" type="artist" title="Adamski" summary="Born in the late &apos;60s, Adamski (born Adam Tinley) appeared to have reached the perfect age for recording twenty years later, square in the middle of Britain&apos;s acid house boom. In fact, he had made his chart debut a decade earlier with the adolescent punk band the Stupid Babies. (The group, which also included his five-year-old brother Dominic on vocals, hit number three on the indie charts with Baby Sitters and even recorded a radio session for John Peel.) Also a member of the post-punk hip-hop band Diskord Datkord during the mid-&apos;80s, Tinley became interested in house music by the end of the decade. After meeting Chicagoan Jimi Polo, Adamski was introduced to many major figures in house, including Marshall Jefferson and Adonis. He learned the basics of the sequencer from Polo as well, and began playing live at warehouse parties and raves around London.&#xD;&#xA;He signed with MCA by the end of the decade and debuted with &quot;N-R-G,&quot; a number 12 hit in the U.K. (He was later forced to turn over some royalties due to a dispute with lawyers, who contended that the track hoisted a TV commercial melody.) His subsequent single, &quot;Killer,&quot; wisely forestalled the (recognizable) samples and hit number one -- though thanks may also be due to its vocalist, Seal. His debut album Liveandirect made a bit of an impression, with mixes of both &quot;N-R-G&quot; and &quot;Killer&quot; to recommend itself, and his late-&apos;90 single &quot;The Space Jungle&quot; hit the Top Ten as well. As was far from surprising with the British rave movement, however, Adamski disappeared from the charts after 1992, when his third album Naughty was released. Six years later, he resurfaced on ZTT with Adamski&apos;s Thing. ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60596/thumb/1445625284" art="/library/metadata/60596/art/1445625284" addedAt="1438445712" updatedAt="1445625284">

  <Directory ratingKey="60580" key="/library/metadata/60580/children" type="artist" title="Adele" summary="When the U.K. press began dubbing Adele &quot;the next Amy Winehouse&quot; in late 2007, the hype didn&apos;t touch upon the heavy singer/songwriter influence found in the Londoner&apos;s music. Influenced by Suzanne Vega as much as Jill Scott, Adele first made an impression in 2006 when she toured as an opening act for Jack Penate. She had graduated to headlining status by the end of 2007, thanks to BBC Radio 1 playing her single &quot;Daydreamer&quot;; another song, &quot;Hometown Glory,&quot; was also released as a single on Jamie T.&apos;s label, Pacemaker. An appearance alongside Paul McCartney and BjÃ¶rk on the BBC 2 television show Later with Jools Holland came next, and a recording contract with XL Recordings was finalized soon after. Early 2008 brought similar luck as Adele found herself atop the BBC&apos;s new music talent list, which was compiled from the votes of 150 music critics. That same January, XL issued a new single, &quot;Chasing Pavements,&quot; along with her debut album, 19. The title reflected Adele&apos;s age at the time of the album&apos;s release, and its popularity resulted in the release of several bonus editions throughout the year. Also in 2009, Adele won Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.&#xD;&#xA;Her sophomore album, 21, featuring the gospel and disco-infused single &quot;Rolling in the Deep,&quot; was released in February of 2011. The album proved to be both a critical and commercial success, becoming one of the longest-running number one albums in history and spending over 18 weeks at the top spot. The glow of 21&apos;s success was dimmed somewhat when Adele was forced to cancel her tour after suffering a hemorrhage on her vocal chords. She underwent surgery for the hemorrhage in November of 2011. That same month, she released the concert CD/DVD Live at the Royal Albert Hall. Both Adele and 21 received many end-of-year honors, and in February 2012, as album sales began to creep closer to ten million copies, she won six major Grammy awards, one of the few artists in history to accomplish the feat in one night. In October 2012, Adele announced that she had recorded the theme to the 23rd Bond film, Skyfall. Produced by Paul Epworth and recorded at the prestigious Abbey Road Studios, the single entered the top 10 of both the UK singles chart and the Billboard Hot 100 on release. By early 2013, 21 had registered sales of over 25 million copies. ~ David Jeffries" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60580/thumb/1445625301" art="/library/metadata/60580/art/1445625301" addedAt="1438454462" updatedAt="1445625301">

Formed in 2006, the group initially took shape as a Los Angeles-based duo, with Jollett and drummer Daren Taylor serving as the only members. A roster expansion was eventually needed; as a result, classically trained violinist Anna Bulbrook was brought in to play viola and keyboards, jazz bassist Noah Harmon joined up, and the empty guitar slot was filled by Steven Chen. The band&apos;s first show as the Airborne Toxic Event took place in fall of 2006, and was followed by a regional rise to stardom, attracting offers from indie labels and accolades from magazines like Rolling Stone. &#xD;&#xA;Riding the wave of industry buzz, the Event released their first EP and accompanying single (both titled Does This Mean You&apos;re Moving On?) in 2007, which only helped to heighten the band&apos;s standing in the indie scene. They signed with Majordomo Records in 2008 and released their self-titled first album, The Airborne Toxic Event, later that year. &quot;Sometime Around Midnight&quot; became a Top Ten modern rock hit, prompting Island Records to sign the band in early 2009. Two years later, the Airborne Toxic Event -- now signed to the same label as one of their major influences, U2 -- issued their sophomore release, All at Once.

  <Directory ratingKey="58170" key="/library/metadata/58170/children" type="artist" title="Alanis Morissette" summary="Alanis Morissette was one of the most unlikely stars of the mid-&apos;90s. A former child actress turned dance-pop diva, Morissette later transformed herself into a confessional alternative singer/songwriter in the vein of Liz Phair and Tori Amos. However, she bolstered that formula with enough pop sensibility, slight hip-hop flourishes, and marketing savvy to become a superstar with her third album, Jagged Little Pill.&#xD;&#xA;Morissette was born in Ottawa, Canada, and began playing piano and writing songs during her childhood years. She also joined the cast of You Can&apos;t Do That on Television, a children&apos;s television program. Using money that she earned on the show, Morissette recorded an independent single, &quot;Fate Stay with Me,&quot; which was released when she was only ten years old. Morissette then concentrated on a musical career after leaving the show&apos;s cast, signing a music publishing contract when she was 14. The publishing contract led to a record deal with MCA Canada, and Morissette moved to Toronto before releasing her debut album, Alanis, in 1991.&#xD;&#xA;Alanis was a collection of pop-oriented dance numbers and ballads that found success in Canada, selling over 100,000 copies and earning the singer a Juno Award for Most Promising Female Artist. However, no other country paid much attention to the record. In 1992, Morissette released Now Is the Time, an album that closely resembled her debut. Like its predecessor, it was a success in Canada, even if its sales did not match those of Alanis. Following the release of Now Is the Time, Morissette relocated to Los Angeles, where she met veteran producer Glen Ballard in early 1994. Ballard had previously written Michael Jackson&apos;s hit single &quot;Man in the Mirror,&quot; produced Wilson Phillips&apos; hit debut album, and worked with actor/musician David Hasselhoff. The two decided to work together, and despite their shared experience with mainstream pop, they opted instead to pursue an edgier, alternative rock-oriented direction. The result was Jagged Little Pill, which was released in 1995 on Madonna&apos;s label, Maverick Records.&#xD;&#xA;On the strength of the angst-ridden single &quot;You Oughta Know,&quot; Jagged Little Pill gained attention upon its release in the summer of 1995. The song soon received heavy airplay from alternative radio outlets and MTV, sending the album into the Top Ten and helping it achieve multi-platinum status. Jagged Little Pill&apos;s subsequent singles -- &quot;Hand in My Pocket,&quot; &quot;All I Really Want,&quot; &quot;You Learn,&quot; &quot;Ironic,&quot; and &quot;All I Really Want&quot; -- kept the album in the Top Ten for an astounding 69 weeks, and Alanis Morissette was nominated for six Grammys in early 1996. She won several of those awards, including Album of the Year and Song of the Year. &#xD;&#xA;While she never managed to replicate the success of Jagged Little Pill, Morissette continued to release well-received albums into the 21st century. Her much-anticipated follow-up, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, was released in the autumn of 1998, setting a record for the highest first-week sales by a female artist. An Unplugged set appeared a year later and featured a cover of the Police&apos;s &quot;King of Pain,&quot; while 2002&apos;s Under Rug Swept saw Morissette writing and producing without the help of collaborators. So-Called Chaos followed in 2004. A year later, she took Jagged Little Pill on the road as an acoustic tour. Those tour dates led to the release of Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, an album originally (and tellingly) sold exclusively through Starbucks outlets. Morissette and her fans had grown up, and Collection -- an 18-track retrospective of her work -- followed in November 2005. But Morissette wasn&apos;t done, returning in 2008 with her seventh studio effort (and fifth international release), Flavors of Entanglement. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58170/thumb/1445624486" art="/library/metadata/58170/art/1445624486" addedAt="1438451291" updatedAt="1445624486">

  <Directory ratingKey="63877" key="/library/metadata/63877/children" type="artist" title="The Album Leaf" titleSort="Album Leaf" summary="The Album Leaf is the solo project of Jimmy LaValle, a San Diego-based songwriter who began recording solo material one year after forming the post-rock band Tristeza. Inspired by a number of genres -- classical, jazz, and post-rock among them -- LaValle constructed his own songs in a similarly eclectic manner, utilizing everything from ambient noise to field recordings to radio transmissions. An Orchestrated Rise to Fall introduced the resulting sound in 1999. An EP (In an Off White Room) preceded the release of LaValle&apos;s second full-length album, One Day I&apos;ll Be on Time, which was released by Tiger Style in March 2001. The Album Leaf&apos;s profile blossomed as a result of those recordings, and LaValle found himself opening shows for Sigur RÃ³s&apos; first American tour that fall. By the time he began recording his third album, he&apos;d also secured the services of Sigur RÃ³s&apos; Iceland studios, along with the participation of several of that band&apos;s members. The resulting album, In a Safe Place, appeared on the Sub Pop label in June 2004. &#xD;&#xA;The Seal Beach EP, originally issued in 2003 in Spain, appeared stateside in early 2005, and LaValle&apos;s next album, Into the Blue Again, followed in September 2006. The Album Leaf toured sporadically throughout the remainder of the decade, performing in multiple continents and opening for Devendra Banhart at the Hollywood Bowl in 2008. Two years later, LaValle returned with his fifth full-length album, A Chorus of Storytellers. ~ Mike DaRonco" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63877/thumb/1445626894" art="/library/metadata/63877/art/1445626894" addedAt="1438448227" updatedAt="1445626894">

  <Directory ratingKey="60552" key="/library/metadata/60552/children" type="artist" title="Amy Winehouse" summary="Much can be said about the late Amy Winehouse, one of the U.K.&apos;s flagship vocalists during the 2000s. The British press and tabloids seemed to focus on her rowdy behavior, heavy consumption of alcohol, and tragic end, but fans and critics alike embraced her rugged charm, brash sense of humor, and distinctively soulful and jazzy vocals. Her platinum-selling breakthrough album, Frank (2003), elicited comparisons ranging from Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan to Macy Gray and Lauryn Hill. Interestingly enough, despite her strong accent and vernacular, one can often hear aspects of each of those singers&apos; vocal repertoire in Winehouse&apos;s own voice. Nonetheless, her allure had always been her songwriting -- almost always deeply personal but best known for its profanity and brutal candor.&#xD;&#xA;Born to a taxi-driving father and a pharmacist mother, Winehouse grew up in the Southgate area of northern London. Her upbringing was surrounded by jazz. Many of the uncles on her mother&apos;s side were professional jazz musicians, and even her paternal grandmother was romantically involved with British jazz legend Ronnie Scott at one time. While at home, she listened to and absorbed her parents&apos; selection of greats: Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra among others. However, in her teens, she was drawn to the rebellious spirit of TLC, Salt-N-Pepa, and other American R&amp;B and hip-hop acts of the time. At the age of 16, after she had been expelled from London&apos;s Sylvia Young Theatre School, she caught her first break when pop singer Tyler James, a schoolmate and close friend, passed on her demo tape to his A&amp;R representative, who was searching for a jazz vocalist. That opportunity led to her recording contract with Island Records. By the end of 2003, when she was 20 years old, Island had released her debut album, Frank. With contributions from hip-hop producer/keyboardist Salaam Remi, Winehouse&apos;s amalgam of jazz, pop, soul, and hip-hop received rave reviews. The album was nominated for the 2004 Mercury Music Prize as well as two Brit Awards, and its lead single, &quot;Stronger Than Me,&quot; won an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song.&#xD;&#xA;Following Winehouse&apos;s debut, the accolades and inquiring interviews appeared concurrently in the press with her tempestuous public life. Several times she showed up to her club or TV performances too drunk to sing an entire set. In 2006, her management company finally suggested that she enter rehab for alcohol abuse, but instead, she dumped the company and transcribed the ordeal into the U.K. Top Ten hit &quot;Rehab,&quot; the lead single for her second, critically acclaimed album, Back to Black. Containing evocative productions from Salaam Remi and British DJ/multi-instrumentalist Mark Ronson, the album somewhat abandoned jazz, delving into the sounds of &apos;50s/&apos;60s-era girl group harmonies, rock &amp; roll, and soul. The fanfare over the release was so great that it started to spill over onto U.S. shores; several rappers and DJs made their own remixes of various songs, not to mention covers by Prince and the Arctic Monkeys.&#xD;&#xA;One month after Winehouse won Best Female Artist at the Brit Awards in February 2007, Universal released Back to Black in the U.S. The LP charted higher than any other American debut by a British female recording artist before it, and it remained in the Top Ten for several months, selling a million copies by the end of that summer. Just as in the U.K., she became the talk of the town, landing on the covers of Rolling Stone and Spin magazines. Not long afterward, though, Winehouse canceled her North American tour. Early reports revealed that she was entering rehab for alcohol and drug addiction, but her new management denied the claims, stating it was due to severe exhaustion. Her erratic behavior kept her and her new husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, in the tabloids constantly, on and off stages on both sides of the Atlantic, but in late 2007, American fans were finally given a chance to hear Winehouse&apos;s early work, with a slightly abbreviated (two songs removed and one added) version of Frank.&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, the next four years were filled with drama, disappointment, and very little music. By 2009, her marriage had ended in divorce, she had repeatedly been arrested on assault charges and/or public order offenses, her struggles with substance abuse and mental health issues tragically played out in the press. Public performances turned into incoherent disasters, the worst of them posted to video-sharing sites for all to see. A track on the Quincy Jones tribute Q: Soul Bossa Nostra appeared in 2010, while a duet with Tony Bennett was announced in early 2011, but a planned follow-up to Back to Black would never make it past the demo stage. Winehouse was found dead in her Camden, London apartment on July 23, 2011. The coroner&apos;s report, delivered three months later, revealed that her blood alcohol content had reached a potentially fatal level.&#xD;&#xA;Nearly two months after her death, Winehouse&apos;s first posthumous appearance was released on Tony Bennett&apos;s Duets II, where she duetted with Bennett on &quot;Body and Soul.&quot; Near the end of 2011, her family&apos;s foundation announced the release of Lioness: Hidden Treasures, a posthumous compilation featuring recordings from throughout her career (although a few of the arrangements were recorded after her death). A year after Lioness came At the BBC, a deluxe CD/DVD set -- available both as a four-disc box and a smaller two-disc compilation -- rounding up all of her live performances for the British Broadcasting Company. ~ Cyril Cordor" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60552/thumb/1445625323" art="/library/metadata/60552/art/1445625323" addedAt="1438455221" updatedAt="1445625323">

  <Directory ratingKey="60525" key="/library/metadata/60525/children" type="artist" title="Angels &amp; Airwaves" summary="With the hiatus of pop-punk superstars blink-182 in full effect by the fall of 2005, singer/guitarist Tom DeLonge revealed the formation of his new band -- one he&apos;d already been working with for six months -- called Angels &amp; Airwaves. Much hype ensued after the announcement. In interviews with outlets like MTV.com, DeLonge proclaimed that his new music would borrow elements from bands like U2 and Pink Floyd and, ultimately, be something of a revolution to change the face of rock &amp; roll forever. Rounding out his lineup were guitarist David Kennedy (Boxcar Racer, Hazen Street), drummer Atom Willard (Rocket from the Crypt, the Offspring), and bassist Ryan Sinn (the Distillers), and the group made its live debut on April 12, 2006, to a sold-out crowd at Pomona, California&apos;s Glass House. Those unable to attend the show were given a taste of Angels &amp; Airwaves&apos; shimmering, arena-ready rock later that spring, when We Don&apos;t Need to Whisper was released on the Geffen label. &#xD;&#xA;We Don&apos;t Need to Whisper was met with mixed reviews but went gold nonetheless, due in large part to a popular pre-sale that ensured the band a healthy first week of sales. Several U.K. festival appearances and a month-long headlining tour followed, and the group also served as an opening act for Head Automatica for Taking Back Sunday during a tour of American venues.  After replacing Sinn with former 30 Seconds to Mars bassist Matt Wachter, Angels &amp; Airwaves returned in 2007 with their second album, the equally dramatic I-Empire. Although deemed by DeLonge to be &quot;as exciting as rock &apos;n&apos; roll gets!&quot; in an interview with Kerrang!, I-Empire didn&apos;t fare nearly as well as the previous album, with sales eventually stalling around 260,000 copies in America. A stateside tour in early 2008 proved to be fairly popular, though, and the group remained on the road by joining the Warped Tour later that year. &#xD;&#xA;At the Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009, DeLonge climbed on-stage with Travis Barker and Mark Hoppus to announce plans for a blink-182 reunion. The band toured that summer and spent significant time in the recording studio, where sessions for a new blink-182 album kept DeLonge busy. He found enough free time to record a third album with Angels &amp; Airwaves, however, and the finished product -- simply titled Love -- was released free of charge on Valentine&apos;s Day 2010. The second part of Love arrived in November of 2011, not long after DeLonge released his reunion album with blink-182, along with a set that combined both parts of the album. ~ Corey Apar &amp; Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60525/thumb/1445625222" art="/library/metadata/60525/art/1445625222" addedAt="1438457649" updatedAt="1445625222">

  <Directory ratingKey="60485" key="/library/metadata/60485/children" type="artist" title="Annie Lennox" summary="Following the disbandment of Eurythmics in 1991, vocalist Annie Lennox began a solo career that rivaled Eurythmics&apos; in terms of crossover popularity. Born and raised in Aberdeen, Scotland, Lennox began playing music as child, learning how to play both the piano and flute. In her late teens, she won a scholarship to London&apos;s Royal Academy of Music, but she dropped out of the school before she took her finals. For the next several years, she worked around London, performing various jobs during the day and singing at night. In the late &apos;70s, she met guitarist Dave Stewart through a friend. Stewart, who had previously played with Longdancer, asked Lennox to join a new band he was forming with a songwriter named Peet Coombes. The band was named the Tourists, and they released three albums between 1979 and 1980 and scored a number four U.K. hit with a cover of Dusty Springfield&apos;s &quot;I Only Want to Be with You.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;While they were collaborating together in the Tourists, Lennox and Stewart became lovers. Soon, tensions within the band grew, and by 1980 the pair had left the band to begin Eurythmics. During the early &apos;80s, the sleek synth pop of Eurythmics became one of the most popular sounds of new wave, racking up a number of hits in both the U.S. and U.K., including &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),&quot; &quot;Love Is a Stranger,&quot; &quot;Who&apos;s That Girl,&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again.&quot; Midway through their career, Eurythmics began pursuing a harder, more straightforward rock &amp; roll sound.&#xD;&#xA;In 1990, following the release of Eurythmics&apos; commercial disappointment We Too Are One, Lennox announced that she was taking a two-year sabbatical to have a child. During this time, the group quietly dissolved, Lennox had a baby, and she began working on her first solo album. Diva, her solo debut, arrived in 1992 and showcased a calmer, more mature vocalist designed to cross over into the adult contemporary market. On the strength of the singles &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot; (number 14) and &quot;Why&quot; (number 34), Diva sold over two million copies in the U.S. alone; the album was also nominated for three Grammy awards.&#xD;&#xA;Lennox delivered her second solo album, a covers collection entitled Medusa, in 1995. Peaking at number 11, Medusa spawned the hit single &quot;No More I Love You&apos;s,&quot; and went platinum by the end of 1995. Lennox took some time off to raise her child and become more actively involved with humanitarian endeavors. A full eight years after Medusa was released, she returned with Bare, one of the strongest and most personal albums of her career. After another break, she released Songs of Mass Destruction in September 2007 and made plans to embark on an extensive North American tour, starting in October. In 2010 Lennox returned to recording with her first holiday album, entitled A Christmas Cornucopia. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60485/thumb/1445625229" art="/library/metadata/60485/art/1445625229" addedAt="1438455931" updatedAt="1445625229">

  <Directory ratingKey="60453" key="/library/metadata/60453/children" type="artist" title="Aphex Twin" summary="Exploring the experimental possibilities inherent in acid and ambience, the two major influences on home-listening techno during the late &apos;80s, Richard D. James&apos; recordings as Aphex Twin brought him more critical praise than any other electronic artist during the 1990s. Though his first major single, &quot;Didgeridoo,&quot; was a piece of acid thrash designed to tire dancers during his DJ sets, ambient stylists and critics later took him under their wing for Selected Ambient Works 85-92, a sublime touchstone in the field of ambient techno. James&apos; reaction to the exposure portrayed an artist unwilling to become either pigeonholed or categorizable. His second Aphex Twin album, Selected Ambient Works, Vol. 2, was so minimal as to be barely conscious -- in what appeared to be an elaborate joke on the electronic community. Follow-ups showed James gradually returning to his hardcore and acid roots, even while his stated desire to crash the British Top Ten (and perform on Top of the Pops) resulted in a series of cartoonish pop songs whose twisted genius was near-masked by their many absurdities. His iconoclastic behavior surprisingly aligned with MTV audiences turned on to end-of-the-millennium nihilist pop along the lines of Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails.&#xD;&#xA;James began taking apart electronics gear as a teenager growing up in Cornwall, England. (If the title Selected Ambient Works 85-92 is to be believed, it contains recordings made at the age of 14.) Inspired by acid house in the late &apos;80s, James began DJing raves around Cornwall. His first release was the Analogue Bubblebath EP, recorded with Tom Middleton and released on the Mighty Force label in September 1991. Middleton left later that year to form Global Communication, after which James recorded a second volume in the Analogue Bubblebath series. This EP (the first to include &quot;Digeridoo&quot;) got some airplay on the London pirate radio station Kiss FM, and prompted Belgium&apos;s R&amp;S Records to sign him early the following year. A re-recording of &quot;Digeridoo&quot; made number 55 in the British charts just after its April 1992 release date, and James followed with the Xylem Tube EP in June. He also co-formed (with Grant Wilson-Claridge) his own Rephlex label around that time, releasing a series of singles as Caustic Window during 1992-1993. Available in cruelly limited editions, most of the recordings continued the cold acid precision of &quot;Digeridoo&quot; -- though several expressed humor and fragility barely dreamed of in the hardcore/rave scene to that point.&#xD;&#xA;The climate for &quot;intelligent&quot; techno had begun to warm in the early &apos;90s, though. The Orb had proved the commercial viability of ambient house with their chart-topping &quot;Blue Room&quot; single, and R&amp;S scrambled to find useful material from its own artists. In November 1992, James acquiesced with Selected Ambient Works 85-92, consisting mostly of home material recorded during the past few years. Simply stated, it was a masterpiece of ambient techno, the genre&apos;s second work of brilliance after the Orb&apos;s Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld. As his star began to shine, several bands approached him to remix their work, and he complied, with mostly unrecognizable reworkings of tracks by St. Etienne, the Cure, Jesus Jones, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Curve.&#xD;&#xA;Early in 1993, Richard James signed to Warp Records, the influential British label that virtually introduced the concept of futuristic &quot;electronic listening music&quot; with a series of albums (subtitled Artificial Intelligence) by ambient techno pioneers Black Dog, Autechre, B12, and FUSE (aka Richie Hawtin) among others. James&apos; release in the series, titled Surfing on Sine Waves, was recorded as Polygon Window and released in January 1993. The album charted a course between the raw muscle of James&apos; nose-bleed techno and the understated minimalism of Selected Ambient Works. A deal between Warp and TVT gave Surfing on Sine Waves an American release (James&apos; first) by the summer. A second album was released that year, Analogue Bubblebath 3, for Rephlex. Recorded as AFX, the LP renounced any debt to ambient music and was the most bracing work yet in the Aphex Twin canon. On a tour of America with Orbital and Moby later that year, James clung to the headbanging material, to the detriment of his mostly unreplaceable gear. He later cut down on his live performance schedule.&#xD;&#xA;In December of 1993, the new single &quot;On&quot; resulted in James&apos; highest chart placing, a number 32 spot on the British charts. The two-part single included remixes by old pal Tom Middleton (as Reload) and future Rephlex star Âµ-Ziq. Despite James&apos; appearance on the pop charts, his following album, Selected Ambient Works, Vol. 2, appeared to be a joke on the ambient techno community. So minimal as to be barely conscious, the quadruple album left most of the beats behind, with only tape loops of unsettling ambient noise remaining. The album mostly struck out with critics but hit number 11 on the British charts and earned James a major-label American contract with Sire soon afterward. During 1994, he worked on the ever-growing Rephlex stable, signing Âµ-Ziq (Michael Paradinas), Kosmik Kommando (Mike Dred), and Kinesthesia/Cylob (Chris Jeffs) to the label. In August 1994, he released the fourth Analogue Bubblebath, this one a five-track EP.&#xD;&#xA;The year 1995 began with the January release of Classics, a compilation of his early R&amp;S singles. Two months later, James released the single &quot;Ventolin,&quot; a harsh, appropriately wheezing ode to the asthma drug on which he relied. I Care Because You Do followed in April, pairing his hardcore experimentalism with more symphonic ambient material, aligned with the work of many post-classical composers -- including Philip Glass, who arranged an orchestral version of the album&apos;s &quot;Icct Hedral&quot; on the August 1995 single Donkey Rhubarb.&#xD;&#xA;Later that year, the Hangable Auto Bulb EP replaced Analogue Bubblebath 3 as Aphex Twin&apos;s most brutal, uncompromising release -- a fusion of experimental music and jungle being explored at the same time on releases by Plug and Squarepusher. In July 1996, Rephlex released the long-awaited collaboration between Richard James and Michael Paradinas (Âµ-Ziq). The album, Expert Knob Twiddlers (credited to Mike &amp; Rich), watered down the experimentalism of Aphex Twin with Âµ-Ziq&apos;s easy-listening electro-funk. The fourth proper Aphex Twin album, November 1996&apos;s Richard D. James Album, continued his forays into acid-jungle and experimental music. Retaining the experimental edge, but with a stated wish to make the British pop charts, James&apos; next two releases, 1997&apos;s Come to Daddy EP and 1999&apos;s Windowlicker EP, were acid storms of industrial drum&apos;n&apos;bass. The accompanying videos, both directed by Chris Cunningham, featured the bodies of small children and female models (respectively) dancing around, all with special-effects-created Aphex Twin faces grinning maniacally.&#xD;&#xA;James released nothing during the year 2000, but did record the score to Flex, a Chris Cunningham short film exhibited as part of the Apocalypse exhibition at London&apos;s Royal Academy. With very little advance warning, another LP, Drukqs, finally arrived in late 2001. Although James continued making frequent DJ appearances, he released no more material until 2005, when Rephlex issued the first installment in a lengthy, 11-part series of 12&quot; singles titled Analord. The singles&apos; minimalist acid techno harked back to his Caustic Window/Analogue Bubblebath material of the early &apos;90s. Chosen Lords, a CD compilation of some of the Analord material, appeared in April 2006. James continued to DJ and play live, and in 2009 the Rushup Edge LP appeared under the performer name of the Tuss; although James and Rephlex denied that it was his work, rumors persisted that it was yet another Aphex pseudonym. Additional rumors during the late 2000s promised official releases from James, but they proved unfounded. ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60453/thumb/1445625202" art="/library/metadata/60453/art/1445625202" addedAt="1438450307" updatedAt="1445625202">

  <Directory ratingKey="62447" key="/library/metadata/62447/children" type="artist" title="The Beatles" titleSort="Beatles" summary="So much has been said and written about the Beatles -- and their story is so mythic in its sweep -- that it&apos;s difficult to summarize their career without restating clichÃ©s that have already been digested by tens of millions of rock fans. To start with the obvious, they were the greatest and most influential act of the rock era, and introduced more innovations into popular music than any other rock band of the 20th century. Moreover, they were among the few artists of any discipline that were simultaneously the best at what they did and the most popular at what they did. Relentlessly imaginative and experimental, the Beatles grabbed a hold of the international mass consciousness in 1964 and never let go for the next six years, always staying ahead of the pack in terms of creativity but never losing their ability to communicate their increasingly sophisticated ideas to a mass audience. Their supremacy as rock icons remains unchallenged to this day, decades after their breakup in 1970. &#xD;&#xA;It&apos;s hard to convey the scope of the Beatles&apos; achievements in a mere paragraph or two. They synthesized all that was good about early rock &amp; roll, and changed it into something original and even more exciting. They established the prototype for the self-contained rock group that wrote and performed its own material. As composers, their craft and melodic inventiveness were second to none, and key to the evolution of rock from its blues/R&amp;B-based forms into a style that was far more eclectic, but equally visceral. As singers, both John Lennon and Paul McCartney were among the best and most expressive vocalists in rock; the group&apos;s harmonies were intricate and exhilarating. As performers, they were (at least until touring had ground them down) exciting and photogenic; when they retreated into the studio, they were instrumental in pioneering advanced techniques and multi-layered arrangements. They were also the first British rock group to achieve worldwide prominence, launching a British Invasion that made rock truly an international phenomenon. &#xD;&#xA;More than any other top group, the Beatles&apos; success was very much a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Their phenomenal cohesion was due in large degree to most of the group having known each other and played together in Liverpool for about five years before they began to have hit records. Guitarist and teenage rebel John Lennon got hooked on rock &amp; roll  in the mid-&apos;50s, and formed a band, the Quarrymen, at his high school. Around mid-1957, the Quarrymen were joined by another guitarist, Paul McCartney, nearly two years Lennon&apos;s junior. A bit later they were joined by another guitarist, George Harrison, a friend of McCartney. The Quarrymen would change lineups constantly in the late &apos;50s, eventually reducing to the core trio of guitarists, who&apos;d proven themselves to be the best musicians and most personally compatible individuals within the band. &#xD;&#xA;The Quarrymen changed their name to the Silver Beatles in 1960, quickly dropping the &quot;Silver&quot; to become just the Beatles. Lennon&apos;s art college friend Stuart Sutcliffe joined on bass, but finding a permanent drummer was a vexing problem until Pete Best joined in the summer of 1960. He successfully auditioned for the combo just before they left for a several-month stint in Hamburg, Germany.&#xD;&#xA;Hamburg was the Beatles&apos; baptism by fire. Playing grueling sessions for hours on end in one of the most notorious red-light districts in the world, the group was forced to expand its repertoire, tighten up its chops, and invest its show with enough manic energy to keep the rowdy crowds satisfied. When they returned to Liverpool at the end of 1960, the band -- formerly also-rans on the exploding Liverpudlian &quot;beat&quot; scene -- were suddenly the most exciting act on the local circuit. They consolidated their following in 1961 with constant gigging in the Merseyside area, most often at the legendary Cavern Club, the incubator of the Merseybeat sound.&#xD;&#xA;They also returned for engagements in Hamburg during 1961, although Sutcliffe dropped out of the band that year to concentrate on his art school studies there. McCartney took over on bass, Harrison settled in as lead guitarist, and Lennon had rhythm guitar; everyone sang. In mid-1961, the Beatles (minus Sutcliffe) made their first recordings in Germany, as a backup group to a British rock guitarist/singer based in Hamburg, Tony Sheridan. The Beatles hadn&apos;t fully developed at this point, and these recordings -- many of which (including a couple of Sheridan-less tracks) were issued only after the band&apos;s rise to fame -- found their talents in a most embryonic state. The Hamburg stint was also notable for gaining the Beatles sophisticated, artistic fans such as Sutcliffe&apos;s girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, who influenced all of them (except Best) to restyle their quiffs in the moptops that gave the musicians their most distinctive visual trademark. (Sutcliffe, tragically, would die of a brain hemorrhage in April 1962). &#xD;&#xA;Near the end of 1961, the Beatles&apos; exploding local popularity caught the attention of local record store manager Brian Epstein, who was soon managing the band as well. He used his contacts to swiftly acquire a January 1, 1962, audition at Decca Records that has been heavily bootlegged (some tracks were officially released in 1995). After weeks of deliberation, Decca turned them down as did several other British labels. Epstein&apos;s perseverance was finally rewarded with an audition for producer George Martin at Parlophone, an EMI subsidiary; Martin signed the Beatles in mid-1962. By this time, Epstein was assiduously grooming his charges for national success by influencing them to smarten up their appearance, dispensing with their leather jackets and trousers in favor of tailored suits and ties. &#xD;&#xA;One more major change was in the offing before the Beatles made their Parlophone debut. In August 1962, drummer Pete Best was kicked out of the group, a controversial decision that has been the cause of much speculation since. There is still no solid consensus as to whether it was because of his solitary, moody nature; the other Beatles&apos; jealousy of his popularity with the fans; his musical shortcomings (George Martin had already told Epstein that Best wasn&apos;t good enough to drum on recordings); or his refusal to wear his hair in bangs. What seems most likely was that the Beatles simply found his personality incompatible, preferring to enlist Ringo Starr (born Richard Starkey), a drummer with another popular Merseyside outfit, Rory Storm &amp; the Hurricanes. Starr had been in the Beatles for a few weeks when they recorded their first single, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;/&quot;P.S. I Love You,&quot; in September 1962. Both sides of the 45 were Lennon-McCartney originals, and the songwriting team would be credited with most of the group&apos;s material throughout the Beatles&apos; career. &#xD;&#xA;The single, a promising but fairly rudimentary effort, hovered around the lower reaches of the British Top 20. The Beatles phenomenon didn&apos;t truly kick in until &quot;Please Please Me,&quot; which topped the British charts in early 1963. This was the prototype British Invasion single: an infectious melody, charging guitars, and positively exuberant harmonies. The same traits were evident on their third 45, &quot;From Me to You&quot; (a British number one), and their debut LP, Please Please Me. Although it was mostly recorded in a single day, Please Please Me topped the British charts for an astonishing 30 weeks, establishing the group as the most popular rock &amp; roll act ever seen in the U.K. &#xD;&#xA;What the Beatles had done was take the best elements of the rock and pop they loved and make them their own. Since the Quarrymen days, they had been steeped in the classic early rock of Elvis, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins, and the Everly Brothers; they&apos;d also kept an ear open to the early &apos;60s sounds of Motown, Phil Spector, and the girl groups. What they added was an unmatched songwriting savvy (inspired by Brill Building teams such as Gerry Goffin and Carole King), a brash guitar-oriented attack, wildly enthusiastic vocals, and the embodiment of the youthful flair of their generation, ready to dispense with postwar austerity and claim a culture of their own. They were also unsurpassed in their eclecticism, willing to borrow from blues, popular standards, gospel, folk, or whatever seemed suitable for their musical vision. Producer George Martin was the perfect foil for the group, refining their ideas without tinkering with their cores; during the last half of their career, he was indispensable for his ability to translate their concepts into arrangements that required complex orchestration, innovative applications of recording technology, and an ever-widening array of instruments. &#xD;&#xA;Just as crucially, the Beatles were never ones to stand still and milk formulas. All of their subsequent albums and singles would show remarkable artistic progression (though never at the expense of a damn catchy tune). Even on their second LP, With the Beatles (1963), it was evident that their talents as composers and instrumentalists were expanding furiously, as they devised ever more inventive melodies and harmonies, and boosted the fullness of their arrangements. &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; established the group not just as a popular music act, but as a phenomenon never before seen in the British entertainment business, as each single sold over a million copies in the U.K. After some celebrated national TV appearances, Beatlemania broke out across the British Isles in late 1963, and the group generating screams and hysteria at all of their public appearances, musical or otherwise. &#xD;&#xA;Capitol, which had first refusal of the Beatles&apos; recordings in the United States, had declined to issue the group&apos;s first few singles, which ended up appearing on relatively small American independents. Capitol took up its option on &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand,&quot; which stormed to the top of the U.S. charts within weeks of its release on December 26, 1963. The Beatles&apos; television appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show in February of 1964 launched Beatlemania (and the entire British Invasion) on an even bigger scale than it had reached in Britain. In the first week of April 1964, the Beatles had the Top Five best-selling singles in the U.S.; they also had the first two slots on the album charts, as well as other entries throughout the Billboard Top 100. No one had ever dominated the market for popular music so heavily; it&apos;s doubtful that anyone ever will again. The Beatles themselves would continue to reach number one with most of their singles and albums until their 1970 breakup. &#xD;&#xA;Hard as it may be to believe today, the Beatles were often dismissed by cultural commentators of the time as nothing more than a fad that would vanish within months as the novelty wore off. The group ensured this wouldn&apos;t happen by making A Hard Day&apos;s Night in early 1964, a cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ©-style motion picture comedy/musical that cemented their image as &quot;the Fab Four&quot;: happy-go-lucky, individualistic, cheeky, funny lads with nonstop energy. The soundtrack was also a triumph, consisting entirely of Lennon-McCartney tunes, including such standards as the title tune, &quot;And I Love Her,&quot; &quot;If I Fell,&quot; &quot;Can&apos;t Buy Me Love,&quot; and &quot;Things We Said Today.&quot; George Harrison&apos;s resonant 12-string electric guitar leads were hugely influential; the movie helped persuade the Byrds, then folksingers, to plunge all out into rock &amp; roll, and the Beatles (along with Bob Dylan) would be hugely influential on the folk-rock explosion of 1965. The Beatles&apos; success, too, had begun to open the U.S. market for fellow Brits like the Rolling Stones, the Animals, and the Kinks, and inspired young American groups like the Beau Brummels, Lovin&apos; Spoonful, and others to mount a challenge of their own with self-penned material that owed a great debt to Lennon-McCartney. &#xD;&#xA;Between riotous international tours in 1964 and 1965, the Beatles continued to squeeze out more chart-topping albums and singles. (Until 1967, the group&apos;s British albums were often truncated for release in the States; when their catalog was transferred to CD, the albums were released worldwide in their British configurations.) In retrospect, critics have judged Beatles for Sale (late 1964) and Help! (mid-1965) as the band&apos;s least impressive efforts. To some degree, that&apos;s true. Touring and an insatiable market placed heavy demands upon their songwriting, and some of the originals and covers on these records, while brilliant by many group&apos;s standards, were filler in the context of the Beatles&apos; best work. &#xD;&#xA;But when at the top of their game, the group was continuing to push forward. &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; had feedback and brilliant guitar leads; &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; showed the band beginning to incorporate the ringing, metallic, circular guitar lines that would be appropriated by bands like the Byrds; &quot;Help!&quot; was their first burst of confessional lyricism; &quot;Yesterday&quot; employed a string quartet. John Lennon in particular was beginning to exhibit a Dylanesque influence in his songwriting on such folky, downbeat numbers as &quot;I&apos;m a Loser&quot; and &quot;You&apos;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away.&quot; And tracks like &quot;I Don&apos;t Want to Spoil the Party&quot; and &quot;I&apos;ve Just Seen a Face&quot; had a strong country flavor. &#xD;&#xA;Although the Beatles&apos; second film, Help!, was a much sillier and less sophisticated affair than their first feature, it too was a huge commercial success. By this time, though, the Beatles had nothing to prove in commercial terms; the remaining frontiers were artistic challenges that could only be met in the studio. They rose to the occasion at the end of 1965 with Rubber Soul, one of the classic folk-rock records. Lyrically, Lennon, McCartney, and even Harrison (who was now writing some tunes on his own) were evolving beyond boy-girl scenarios into complex, personal feelings. They were also pushing the limits of studio rock by devising new guitar and bass textures, experimenting with distortion and multi-tracking, and using unconventional (for rock) instruments like the sitar. &#xD;&#xA;As much of a progression as Rubber Soul was relative to their previous records, it was but a taster for the boundary-shattering outings of the next few years. The &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;/&quot;Rain&quot; single found the group abandoning romantic themes entirely, boosting the bass to previously unknown levels, and fooling around with psychedelic imagery and backward tapes on the B-side. Drugs (psychedelic and otherwise) were fueling their already fertile imaginations, but they felt creatively hindered by their touring obligations. Revolver, released in the summer of 1966, proved what the group could be capable of when allotted months of time in the studio. Hazy hard guitars and thicker vocal arrangements formed the bed of these increasingly imagistic, ambitious lyrics; the group&apos;s eclecticism now encompassed everything from singalong novelties (&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;) and string quartet-backed character sketches (&quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;) to Indian-influenced swirls of echo and backward tapes (&quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;). Some would complain that the Beatles had abandoned the earthy rock of their roots for clever mannerism. But Revolver, like virtually all of the group&apos;s singles and albums from &quot;She Loves You&quot; on, would be a worldwide chart-topper. &#xD;&#xA;For the past couple of years, live performance had become a rote exercise for the group, tired of competing with thousands of screaming fans that drowned out most of their voices and instruments. A 1966 summer worldwide tour was particularly grueling: the group&apos;s entourage was physically attacked in the Philippines after a perceived snub of the country&apos;s first lady, and a casual remark by John Lennon about the Beatles being bigger than Jesus Christ was picked up in the States, resulting in the burning of Beatle records in the Bible belt and demands for a repentant apology. Their final concert of that American tour (in San Francisco on August 29, 1966) would be their last in front of a paying audience, as the group decided to stop playing live in order to concentrate on their studio recordings. &#xD;&#xA;This was a radical (indeed, unprecedented) step in 1966, and the media was rife with speculation that the act was breaking up, especially after all four spent late 1966 engaged in separate personal and artistic pursuits. The appearance of the &quot;Penny Lane&quot;/&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; single in February 1967 squelched these concerns. Frequently cited as the strongest double A-side ever, the Beatles were now pushing forward into unabashedly psychedelic territory in their use of orchestral arrangements and Mellotron, without abandoning their grasp of memorable melody and immediately accessible lyrical messages. &#xD;&#xA;Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band, released in June 1967 as the Summer of Love dawned, was the definitive psychedelic soundtrack. Or, at least, so it was perceived at the time: subsequent critics have painted the album as an uneven affair, given a conceptual unity via its brilliant multi-tracked overdubs, singalong melodies, and fairy tale-ish lyrics. Others remain convinced, as millions did at the time, that it represented pop&apos;s greatest triumph, or indeed an evolution of pop into art with a capital A. In addition to mining all manner of roots influences, the musicians were also picking up vibes from Indian music, avant-garde electronics, classical, music hall, and more. When the Beatles premiered their hippie anthem &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; as part of a worldwide TV broadcast, they had been truly anointed as spokespersons for their generation (a role they had not actively sought), and it seemed they could do no wrong. &#xD;&#xA;Musically, that would usually continue to be the case, but the group&apos;s strength began to unravel at a surprisingly quick pace. In August 1967, Brian Epstein -- prone to suicidal depression over the past year -- died of a drug overdose, leaving them without a manager. They pressed on with their next film project, Magical Mystery Tour, directed by themselves; lacking focus or even basic professionalism, the picture bombed when it was premiered on BBC television in December 1967, giving the media the first real chance they&apos;d ever had to roast the Beatles over a flame. (Another film, the animated feature Yellow Submarine, would appear in 1968, although the Beatles had little involvement with the project, either in terms of the movie or the soundtrack.) In early 1968, the Beatles decamped to India for a course in transcendental meditation with the Maharishi; this too became something of a media embarrassment as each of the four would eventually depart the course before its completion. &#xD;&#xA;The Beatles did use their unaccustomed peace in India to compose a wealth of new material. Judged solely on musical merit, The White Album, a double LP released in late 1968, was a triumph. While largely abandoning their psychedelic instruments to return to guitar-based rock, they maintained their whimsical eclecticism, proving themselves masters of everything from blues-rock to vaudeville. As individual songwriters, too, it contains some of their finest work (as does the brilliant non-LP single from this era, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;/&quot;Revolution&quot;). &#xD;&#xA;The problem, at least in terms of the group&apos;s long-term health, was that these were very much individual songs, as opposed to collective ones. Lennon and McCartney had long composed most of their tunes separately (you can almost always tell the composer by the lead vocalist). But they had always fed off of each other not only to supply missing bits and pieces that would bring a song to completion, but to provide a competitive edge that would bring out the best in the other. McCartney&apos;s romantic melodicism and Lennon&apos;s more acidic, gritty wit were perfect complements for one another. By The White Album, it was clear (if only in retrospect) that each member was more concerned with his own expression than that of the collective group: a natural impulse, but one that was bound to lead to difficulties. &#xD;&#xA;In addition, George Harrison was becoming a more prolific and skilled composer as well, imbuing his own melodies (which were nearly the equal of those of his more celebrated colleagues) with a cosmic lightness. Harrison was beginning to resent his junior status, and the group began to bicker more openly in the studio. Ringo Starr, whose solid drumming and good nature could usually be counted upon (as was evident in his infrequent lead vocals), actually quit for a couple of weeks in the midst of the White Album sessions (though the media was unaware of this at the time). Personal interests were coming into play as well: Lennon&apos;s devotion to romantic and artistic pursuits with his new girlfriend (and soon-to-be wife) Yoko Ono was diverting his attentions from the Beatles. Apple Records, started by the group earlier in 1968 as a sort of utopian commercial enterprise, was becoming a financial and organizational nightmare. &#xD;&#xA;These weren&apos;t the ideal conditions under which to record a new album in January 1969, especially when McCartney was pushing the group to return to live performing, although none of the others seemed especially keen on the idea. They did agree to try and record a &quot;back-to-basics,&quot; live-in-the-studio-type LP, the sessions being filmed for a television special. That plan almost blew up when Harrison, in the midst of tense arguments, left the group for a few days. Although he returned, the idea of playing live concerts was put on the back burner; Harrison enlisted American soul keyboardist Billy Preston as kind of a fifth member on the sessions, both to beef up the arrangements and to alleviate the uncomfortable atmosphere. Exacerbating the problem was that the Beatles didn&apos;t have a great deal of first-class new songs to work with, although some were excellent. In order to provide a suitable concert-like experience for the film, the group did climb the roof of their Apple headquarters in London to deliver an impromptu performance on January 30, 1969, before the police stopped it; this was their last live concert of any sort. &#xD;&#xA;Generally dissatisfied with these early-1969 sessions, the album and film -- at first titled Get Back, and later to emerge as Let It Be -- remained in the can as the group tried to figure out how the projects should be mixed, packaged, and distributed. A couple of the best tracks, &quot;Get Back&quot;/&quot;Don&apos;t Let Me Down,&quot; were issued as a single in the spring of 1969. By this time, the Beatles&apos; quarrels were intensifying in a dispute over management: McCartney wanted their affairs to be handled by his new father-in-law, Lee Eastman, while the other members of the group favored a tough American businessman, Allen Klein. &#xD;&#xA;It was something of a miracle, then, that the final album recorded by the group, Abbey Road, was one of their most unified efforts (even if, by this time, the musicians were recording many of their parts separately). It certainly boasted some of their most intricate melodies, harmonies, and instrumental arrangements; it also heralded the arrival of Harrison as a composer of equal talent to Lennon and McCartney, as George wrote the album&apos;s two most popular tunes, &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun.&quot; The Beatles were still progressing, but it turned out to be the end of the road, as their business disputes continued to magnify. Lennon, who had begun releasing solo singles and performing with friends as the Plastic Ono Band, threatened to resign in late 1969, although he was dissuaded from making a public announcement. &#xD;&#xA;Most of the early-1969 tapes remained unreleased, partially because the footage for the planned television broadcast of these sessions was now going to be produced as a documentary movie. The accompanying soundtrack album, Let It Be, was delayed so that its release could coincide with that of the film. Lennon, Harrison, and Allen Klein decided to have celebrated American producer Phil Spector record some additional instrumentation and do some mixing. Thus the confusion that persists among most rock listeners to this day: Let It Be, although the last Beatles album to be released, was not the last one to be recorded. Abbey Road should actually be considered as the Beatles&apos; last album; most of the material on Let It Be, including the title track (which would be the last single released while the group was still together), was recorded several months before the Abbey Road sessions began in earnest, and a good 15 months or so before its May 1970 release. &#xD;&#xA;By that time, the Beatles were no more. In fact, there had been no recording done by the group as a unit since August 1969, and each member of the band had begun to pursue serious outside professional interests independently via the Plastic Ono Band, Harrison&apos;s tour with Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Starr&apos;s starring role in the Magic Christian film, or McCartney&apos;s first solo album. The outside world for the most part remained almost wholly unaware of the seriousness of the group&apos;s friction, making it a devastating shock for much of the world&apos;s youth when McCartney announced that he was leaving the Beatles on April 10, 1970. (The &quot;announcement&quot; was actually contained in a press release for his new album, in which his declaration of his intention to work on his own effectively served as a notice of his departure.) &#xD;&#xA;The final blow, apparently, was the conflict between the release dates of Let It Be and McCartney&apos;s debut solo album. The rest of the group asked McCartney to delay his release until after Let It Be; McCartney refused and, for good measure, was distressed by Spector&apos;s post-production work on Let It Be, particularly the string overdubs on &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; which became a posthumous Beatles single that spring. Although McCartney received much of the blame for the split, it should be remembered that he had done more than any other member to keep the group going since Epstein&apos;s death, and that each of the other Beatles had threatened to leave well before McCartney&apos;s departure. With hindsight, the breakup seemed inevitable in view of their serious business disagreements and the growth of their individual interests. &#xD;&#xA;As bitter as the initial headlines were to swallow, the feuding would grow much worse over the next few years. At the end of 1970, McCartney sued the rest of the Beatles in order to dissolve their partnership; the battle dragged through the courts for years, scotching any prospects of a group reunion. In any case, each member of the band quickly established a viable solo career. In fact, at the outset it could have been argued that the artistic effects of the split were in some ways beneficial, freeing Lennon and Harrison to make their most uncompromising artistic statements (Plastic Ono Band and All Things Must Pass). George&apos;s individual talents in particular received acclaim that had always eluded him when he was overshadowed by Lennon-McCartney. Paul had a much rougher time with the critics, but continued to issue a stream of hit singles, hitting a commercial and critical jackpot at the end of 1973 with the massively successful Band on the Run. Ringo did not have the songwriting acumen to compete on the same level as the others, yet he too had quite a few big hit singles in the early &apos;70s, often benefiting from the assistance of his former bandmates. &#xD;&#xA;Yet within a short time, it became apparent both that the Beatles were not going to settle their differences and reunite, and that their solo work could not compare with what they were capable of creating together. The stereotype has it that the split allowed each of them to indulge in their worst tendencies to their extremes: Lennon in agitprop, Harrison in holier-than-thou mysticism, McCartney in cutesy pop, Starr in easy listening rock. There&apos;s a good deal of truth in this, but it&apos;s also important to bear in mind that what was most missing was a sense of group interaction. The critical party line often champions Lennon as the angry, realist rocker, and McCartney as the melodic balladeer, but this is a fallacy: each of them was capable, in roughly equal measures, of ballsy all-out rock and sweet romanticism. What is not in dispute is that they sparked each other to reach heights that they could not attain on their own. &#xD;&#xA;Despite periodic rumors of reunions throughout the 1970s, no group projects came close to materializing. It should be added that the Beatles themselves continued to feud to some degree, and from all evidence weren&apos;t seriously interested in working together as a unit. Any hopes of a reunion vanished when Lennon was assassinated in New York City in December 1980. The Beatles continued their solo careers throughout the 1980s, but their releases became less frequent, and their commercial success gradually diminished as listeners without first-hand memories of the combo created their own idols. &#xD;&#xA;The popularity of the Beatles-as-unit, however, proved eternal. In part, this is because the group&apos;s 1970 split effectively short-circuited the prospects of artistic decline; the body of work that was preserved was uniformly strong. However, it&apos;s also because, like any great works of art, the Beatles&apos; records carried an ageless magnificence that continues to captivate new generations of listeners. So it is that Beatles records continue to be heard on radio in heavy rotation, continue to sell in massive quantities, and continue to be covered and quoted by rock and pop artists through the present day. &#xD;&#xA;Legal wrangles at Apple prevented the official issue of previously unreleased Beatle material for over two decades (although much of it was frequently bootlegged). The situation finally changed in the 1990s, after McCartney, Harrison, Starr, and Lennon&apos;s widow, Yoko Ono, settled their principal business disagreements. In 1994, this resulted in a double CD of BBC sessions from the early and mid-&apos;60s (a second volume followed nearly two decades later). The following year, a much more ambitious project was undertaken: a multi-part film documentary, broadcast on network television in 1995, and then released (with double the length) for the home video market in 1996, with the active participation of the surviving Beatles. &#xD;&#xA;To coincide with the Anthology documentary, three double CDs of previously unreleased/rare material were issued in 1995 and 1996. Additionally, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr (with some assistance from Jeff Lynne) embellished a couple of John Lennon demos from the 1970s with overdubs to create two new tracks (&quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot;) that were billed as actual Beatles recordings. Whether this constituted the actual long-awaited &quot;reunion&quot; is the subject of much debate. Certainly these cuts were hardly classics on par with the music the group made in the 1960s. Some fans, even diehards, were inclined to view the whole Anthology project as a distinctly 1990s marketing exercise that maximized the mileage of whatever could be squeezed from the Beatles&apos; vaults. If nothing else, though, the massive commercial success of outtakes that had, after all, been recorded 25 to 30 years ago, spoke volumes about the unabated appeal and fascination the Beatles continue to exert worldwide. ~ Richie Unterberger" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/62447/thumb/1445626185" art="/library/metadata/62447/art/1445626185" addedAt="1438444629" updatedAt="1445626185">

  <Directory ratingKey="60417" key="/library/metadata/60417/children" type="artist" title="BeyoncÃ©" titleSort="Beyonce" summary="One of the most recognizable characters in modern-day R&amp;B, BeyoncÃ© first rose to fame as the siren-voiced centerpiece of Destiny&apos;s Child before embarking on a multi-platinum solo career in 2001. Booming record sales, Grammy awards, movie roles, and a romance with rapper/CEO Jay-Z combined to heighten her profile in the 2000s, making the singer a virtual mainstay in the entertainment world. While some media outlets derisively championed Paris Hilton as &quot;the next Marilyn Monroe,&quot; BeyoncÃ© was a much better contender for the role, her glittering pop culture persona only matched by her success onscreen and on record. &#xD;&#xA;Born in Houston in September 1981, BeyoncÃ© Giselle Knowles began performing at age seven, winning upwards of 30 local competitions for her dancing and vocal abilities. She also joined her cousin Kelly Rowland and classmates LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett in forming an adolescent vocal group. Mathew Knowles, BeyoncÃ©&apos;s father and Rowland&apos;s legal guardian, signed on to be the girls&apos; manager, eventually quitting his full-time job to focus on their efforts. This situation would ultimately lead to the creation of one of the most popular female R&amp;B groups of all time -- Destiny&apos;s Child.&#xD;&#xA;Destiny&apos;s Child gained momentum throughout the &apos;90s, appearing on Star Search in 1992 (under the name Girl&apos;s Tyme) and weathering several lineup changes before signing to Columbia Records in 1997. Four studio albums later, the group had officially become the best-selling female group of all time, with such smash hits as &quot;Jumpin&apos; Jumpin&apos;,&quot; &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills,&quot; &quot;Say My Name,&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot; bolstering the girls&apos; momentum despite a continued string of lawsuits from former members Roberson and Luckett (who contested Mathew Knowles&apos; management, claiming he withheld profits and unjustly favored his daughter and niece). In 2001, BeyoncÃ©, Rowland, and replacement member Michelle Williams allowed themselves a break from the group to pursue individual solo careers. Before landing several movie roles, BeyoncÃ© became the first African-American female artist and second woman ever to win the annual ASCAP Pop Songwriter of the Year Award. An appearance in the MTV drama Carmen: A Hip Hopera quickly followed, but it was her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in 2002&apos;s Austin Powers in Goldmember that established BeyoncÃ© as a true Hollywood star. &#xD;&#xA;While her inclusion on the movie&apos;s soundtrack failed to chart nationally, BeyoncÃ©&apos;s full-length solo debut, 2003&apos;s Dangerously in Love, reached multi-platinum status. Featuring collaborations with Sean Paul, Missy Elliott, OutKast&apos;s Big Boi, and romantic interest Jay-Z, the album spawned a total of four Top Ten singles and garnered the singer five Grammys. Destiny&apos;s Child reconvened the following year to release Destiny Fulfilled; upon completing the resulting tour, the group issued one final album, a greatest-hits compilation entitled #1&apos;s, and subsequently disbanded. BeyoncÃ© turned her full attention to her burgeoning solo career, releasing the sophomore effort B&apos;day in September 2006 and, three months later, turning in an award-winning performance for the movie musical Dreamgirls. The singer then embarked on the BeyoncÃ© Experience concert tour, releasing a live DVD in November 2007. &#xD;&#xA;The following year proved to be another busy one as BeyoncÃ© landed the role of Etta James in Cadillac Records, a musical biopic that explored the heyday of Chicago&apos;s Chess Records. Shooting commenced in February 2008, with BeyoncÃ© also serving as co-executive producer. One month before the film&apos;s December release, the singer released her third studio album, I Am...Sasha Fierce. The double-disc effort emphasized her two distinct personalities, allowing BeyoncÃ© to explore both mainstream sounds and traditional R&amp;B. Some live releases followed. Released in 2009, I Am...Yours, a CD/DVD set, documented an August 2009 performance at Wynn Las Vegas, while 2010&apos;s I Am...World Tour, available in separate audio and video formats, was recorded at London&apos;s significantly larger O2 Arena (a few months after the Vegas program). She followed ten Grammy nominations with 2011&apos;s 4. One of her most energetic and empowering tracks, &quot;Run the World (Girls),&quot; was issued as the lead single, followed by &quot;Party&quot; and &quot;Countdown.&quot; The album hit the top position on Billboard&apos;s Top 200. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60417/thumb/1445625264" art="/library/metadata/60417/art/1445625264" addedAt="1438456406" updatedAt="1445625264">

  <Directory ratingKey="60319" key="/library/metadata/60319/children" type="artist" title="Blink-182" summary="The new-school punk trio blink-182 were formed in the suburbs of San Diego, California around guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Scott Raynor. Originally known as simply Blink, the band debuted in 1993 with a self-released EP, Fly Swatter. After releasing the album Buddha in 1994, the trio signed to Grilled Cheese/Cargo and released Cheshire Cat the following year. The threat of a lawsuit from a similarly named Irish band forced them to change their name to blink-182, but the group earned a higher profile touring the world with Pennywise and NOFX on the 1996-1997 Warped Tour, plus appearing on innumerable skate/surf/snowboarding videos.&#xD;&#xA;The third blink-182 LP, Dude Ranch, was jointly released in 1997 by Cargo and MCA. Dude Ranch expanded the group&apos;s audience and went platinum by the end of 1998, due in part to the popularity of the infectious teen anthem &quot;Dammit (Growing Up).&quot; The group also signed officially with MCA, which released the band&apos;s fourth album, Enema of the State, in the summer of 1999. The album, produced by Jerry Finn (Green Day, Rancid), also welcomed a new member into the trio&apos;s ranks; Travis Barker, formerly with the Aquabats, settled in on drums after Raynor left midway through a 1998 U.S. tour. Enema was greeted with almost immediate success, and helped the band achieve the mainstream status of toilet-humored pop-punk kings that Dude Ranch had only hinted at. Driven by the commercially successful singles &quot;What&apos;s My Age Again?,&quot; &quot;All the Small Things,&quot; and &quot;Adam&apos;s Song,&quot; music videos for the three songs (whose clips included themes of streaking and boy band spoofs) were MTV smashes as well.&#xD;&#xA;After selling over four million copies of Enema of the State, the trio played on with the limited-edition release The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back) in fall 2000. The album featured their radio hits in a live setting, intertwined with their quirky sense of humor as well as the new song &quot;Man Overboard.&quot; Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, issued in spring 2001, saw the band return to its SoCal punk rock roots. Maturity, of a sort, came with 2003&apos;s self-titled album, released on Geffen. Not only did the album sport a song (&quot;All of This&quot;) that featured Robert Smith of the Cure, but &quot;I Miss You&quot; also topped the modern rock charts in 2005. In February 2005, however, popular as ever and seemingly indestructible, blink-182 unexpectedly announced they would be going on an &quot;indefinite hiatus,&quot; supposedly to spend more time with their growing families. Asking fans for help in selecting tracks, the group issued Greatest Hits that November. &#xD;&#xA;The bandmembers also continued on with other projects. Barker -- who had previously released an album with DeLonge as Boxcar Racer -- continued playing with the Transplants and running his clothing company, Famous Stars and Straps. His family was also spotlighted in the MTV reality show Meet the Barkers. Hoppus carried on with his Atticus fashion venture, began producing -- starting with Motion City Soundtrack&apos;s Commit This to Memory -- and hosting his own podcasts. He further began work with Barker in a new band, Plus 44. DeLonge also continued work with his lifestyle clothing company, Macbeth, and formally announced his new project, Angels and Airwaves, that fall.&#xD;&#xA;In 2009, blink-182 announced that they were reuniting and would be getting back to work on new material as well as touring again, hitting the road with Weezer for their reunion tour. They went into the studio later that year and began laying down the groundwork for a new album, which would be plagued by delays until 2011, when they were eventually able to release their sixth studio album, Neighborhoods. ~ John Bush &amp; Corey Apar" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60319/thumb/1445625159" art="/library/metadata/60319/art/1445625159" addedAt="1438457316" updatedAt="1445625159">

Consisting of singer/guitarist Kele Okereke, guitarist Russell Lissack, bassist/singer Gordon Moakes, and drummer Matt Tong, the band was formerly known as Angel Range and Union before settling on Bloc Party. Okereke and Lissack met each other through mutual friends at the Reading Festival, and discovered that they had musical tastes as well as friends in common. Tong and Moakes soon joined their collaboration, and under the name Union, the quartet issued a demo in early 2003; later that year, they switched their name to Bloc Party. &#xD;&#xA;The group&apos;s demo and concerts began to attract attention from both the press and their peers; Okereke sent a copy of the demo to Franz Ferdinand, who invited them to play at the Domino tenth anniversary bash in fall 2003. Early the following year, the band released one of the demo&apos;s tracks, &quot;She&apos;s Hearing Voices,&quot; as a single on Trash Aesthetics. A few months later, Banquet/Staying Fat arrived on Moshi Moshi. That spring, Bloc Party signed to Wichita to release their full-length album in the U.K., and to Dim Mak for U.S. distribution. The band spent summer 2004 recording and touring. Late that summer, Bloc Party, which collected the band&apos;s first two singles, arrived in the States. &#xD;&#xA;Their debut album, Silent Alarm, appeared early in 2005 and was released by Vice Records in the States to widespread acclaim. Later that year, Silent Alarm Remixed capitalized on the band&apos;s burgeoning popularity, as did the 2006 EP Helicopter. A Weekend in the City, Bloc Party&apos;s second proper album, followed in 2007. A Weekend in the City leaked onto the Internet months before the album&apos;s street date, which inspired Bloc Party to issue their third album, Intimacy, online in late summer 2008; the album was released on compact disc that fall. Late in 2009, Bloc Party went on hiatus and Okereke began working on songs on his own, moving to Berlin and collaborating with producers Hudson Mohawke and XXXchange in New York on a solo album. In 2010, the single Tenderoni arrived, revealing that Okereke&apos;s solo work was more dance-oriented than his music with Bloc Party. His full-length debut, The Boxer, arrived in summer 2010. Meanwhile, Moakes formed a side project, Young Legionnaire, with the Automatic&apos;s Paul Mullen and La Roux&apos;s William Bowerman. The following year, Bloc Party reunited to record their fourth album; that July, the lead single &quot;Octopus&quot; showed that the band had returned to the angular, guitar-heavy sound of their earlier work. Four arrived in August 2012.

  <Directory ratingKey="66877" key="/library/metadata/66877/children" type="artist" title="Bob Dylan" summary="Bob Dylan&apos;s influence on popular music is incalculable. As a songwriter, he pioneered several different schools of pop songwriting, from confessional singer/songwriter to winding, hallucinatory, stream-of-consciousness narratives. As a vocalist, he broke down the notion that a singer must have a conventionally good voice in order to perform, thereby redefining the vocalist&apos;s role in popular music. As a musician, he sparked several genres of pop music, including electrified folk-rock and country-rock. And that just touches on the tip of his achievements. Dylan&apos;s force was evident during his height of popularity in the &apos;60s -- the Beatles&apos; shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-&apos;60s never would have happened without him -- but his influence echoed throughout several subsequent generations, as many of his songs became popular standards and his best albums became undisputed classics of the rock &amp; roll canon. Dylan&apos;s influence throughout folk music was equally powerful, and he marks a pivotal turning point in its 20th century evolution, signifying when the genre moved away from traditional songs and toward personal songwriting. Even when his sales declined in the &apos;80s and &apos;90s, Dylan&apos;s presence rarely lagged, and his commercial revival in the 2000s proved his staying power.&#xD;&#xA;For a figure of such substantial influence, Dylan came from humble beginnings. Born in Duluth, MN, Bob Dylan (b. Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) was raised in Hibbing, MN, from the age of six. As a child he learned how to play guitar and harmonica, forming a rock &amp; roll band called the Golden Chords when he was in high school. Following his graduation in 1959, he began studying art at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. While at college, he began performing folk songs at coffeehouses under the name Bob Dylan, taking his last name from the poet Dylan Thomas. Already inspired by Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie, Dylan began listening to blues while at college, and the genre wove its way into his music. He spent the summer of 1960 in Denver, where he met bluesman Jesse Fuller, the inspiration behind the songwriter&apos;s signature harmonica rack and guitar. By the time he returned to Minneapolis in the fall, he had grown substantially as a performer and was determined to become a professional musician.&#xD;&#xA;Dylan made his way to New York City in January of 1961, immediately making a substantial impression on the folk community of Greenwich Village. He began visiting his idol Guthrie in the hospital, where he was slowly dying from Huntington&apos;s chorea. Dylan also began performing in coffeehouses, and his rough charisma won him a significant following. In April, he opened for John Lee Hooker at Gerde&apos;s Folk City. Five months later, Dylan performed another concert at the venue, which was reviewed positively by Robert Shelton in The New York Times. Columbia A&amp;R man John Hammond sought out Dylan on the strength of the review, and signed the songwriter in the fall of 1961. Hammond produced Dylan&apos;s eponymous debut album (released in March 1962), a collection of folk and blues standards that boasted only two original songs. Over the course of 1962, Dylan began to write a large batch of original songs, many of which were political protest songs in the vein of his Greenwich contemporaries. These songs were showcased on his second album, The Freewheelin&apos; Bob Dylan. Before its release, Freewheelin&apos; went through several incarnations. Dylan had recorded a rock &amp; roll single, &quot;Mixed Up Confusion,&quot; at the end of 1962, but his manager, Albert Grossman, made sure the record was deleted because he wanted to present Dylan as an acoustic folkie. Similarly, several tracks with a full backing band that were recorded for Freewheelin&apos; were scrapped before the album&apos;s release. Furthermore, several tracks recorded for the album -- including &quot;Talking John Birch Society Blues&quot; -- were eliminated from the album before its release.&#xD;&#xA;Comprised entirely of original songs, The Freewheelin&apos; Bob Dylan made a huge impact in the U.S. folk community, and many performers began covering songs from the album. Of these, the most significant were Peter, Paul and Mary, who made &quot;Blowin&apos; in the Wind&quot; into a huge pop hit in the summer of 1963 and thereby made Bob Dylan into a recognizable household name. On the strength of Peter, Paul and Mary&apos;s cover and his opening gigs for popular folkie Joan Baez, Freewheelin&apos; became a hit in the fall of 1963, climbing to number 23 on the charts. By that point, Baez and Dylan had become romantically involved, and she was beginning to record his songs frequently. Dylan was writing just as fast.&#xD;&#xA;By the time The Times They Are A-Changin&apos; was released in early 1964, Dylan&apos;s songwriting had developed far beyond that of his New York peers. Heavily inspired by poets like Arthur Rimbaud and John Keats, his writing took on a more literate and evocative quality. Around the same time, he began to expand his musical boundaries, adding more blues and R&amp;B influences to his songs. Released in the summer of 1964, Another Side of Bob Dylan made these changes evident. However, Dylan was moving faster than his records could indicate. By the end of 1964, he had ended his romantic relationship with Baez and had begun dating a former model named Sara Lowndes, whom he subsequently married. Simultaneously, he gave the Byrds &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; to record for their debut album. The Byrds gave the song a ringing, electric arrangement, but by the time the single became a hit, Dylan was already exploring his own brand of folk-rock. Inspired by the British Invasion, particularly the Animals&apos; version of &quot;House of the Rising Sun,&quot; Dylan recorded a set of original songs backed by a loud rock &amp; roll band for his next album. While Bringing It All Back Home (March 1965) still had a side of acoustic material, it made clear that Dylan had turned his back on folk music. For the folk audience, the true breaking point arrived a few months after the album&apos;s release, when he played the Newport Folk Festival supported by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. The audience greeted him with vicious derision, but he had already been accepted by the growing rock &amp; roll community. Dylan&apos;s spring tour of Britain was the basis for D.A. Pennebaker&apos;s documentary Don&apos;t Look Back, a film that captures the songwriter&apos;s edgy charisma and charm.&#xD;&#xA;Dylan made his breakthrough to the pop audience in the summer of 1965, when &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; became a number two hit. Driven by a circular organ riff and a steady beat, the six-minute single broke the barrier of the three-minute pop single. Dylan became the subject of innumerable articles, and his lyrics became the subject of literary analyses across the U.S. and U.K. Well over 100 artists covered his songs between 1964 and 1966; the Byrds and the Turtles, in particular, had big hits with his compositions. Highway 61 Revisited, his first full-fledged rock &amp; roll album, became a Top Ten hit shortly after its summer 1965 release. &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot; and &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot; became Top Ten hits in the fall of 1965 and spring of 1966, respectively. Following the May 1966 release of the double album Blonde on Blonde, he had sold over ten million records around the world.&#xD;&#xA;During the fall of 1965, Dylan hired the Hawks, formerly Ronnie Hawkins&apos; backing group, as his touring band. The Hawks, who changed their name to the Band in 1968, would become Dylan&apos;s most famous backing band, primarily because of their intuitive chemistry and &quot;wild, thin mercury sound,&quot; but also because of their British tour in the spring of 1966. The tour was the first time the British had heard the electric Dylan, and their reaction was disagreeable and violent. At the Manchester concert (long mistakenly identified as the show from London&apos;s Royal Albert Hall), an audience member called Dylan &quot;Judas,&quot; inspiring a positively vicious version of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; from Dylan and the band. The performance was immortalized on countless bootleg albums (an official release finally surfaced in 1998), and it indicates the intensity of Dylan in the middle of 1966. He had assumed control of Pennebaker&apos;s second Dylan documentary, Eat the Document, and was under deadline to complete his book Tarantula, as well as record a new record. Following the British tour, he returned to America.&#xD;&#xA;On July 29, 1966, he was injured in a motorcycle accident outside of his home in Woodstock, NY, suffering injuries to his neck vertebrae and a concussion. Details of the accident remain elusive -- he was reportedly in critical condition for a week and had amnesia -- and some biographers have questioned its severity, but the event was a pivotal turning point in his career. After the accident, Dylan became a recluse, disappearing into his home in Woodstock and raising his family with his wife, Sara. After a few months, he retreated with the Band to a rented house, subsequently dubbed Big Pink, in West Saugerties to record a number of demos. For several months, Dylan and the Band recorded an enormous amount of material, ranging from old folk, country, and blues songs to newly written originals. The songs indicated that Dylan&apos;s songwriting had undergone a metamorphosis, becoming streamlined and more direct. Similarly, his music had changed, owing less to traditional rock &amp; roll, and demonstrating heavy country, blues, and traditional folk influences. None of the Big Pink recordings was intended to be released, but tapes from the sessions were circulated by Dylan&apos;s music publisher with the intent of generating cover versions. Copies of these tapes, as well as other songs, were available on illegal bootleg albums by the end of the &apos;60s; it was the first time that bootleg copies of unreleased recordings became widely circulated. Portions of the tapes were officially released in 1975 as the double album The Basement Tapes.&#xD;&#xA;While Dylan was in seclusion, rock &amp; roll had become heavier and artier in the wake of the psychedelic revolution. When Dylan returned with John Wesley Harding in December of 1967, its quiet, country ambience was a surprise to the general public, but it was a significant hit, peaking at number two in the U.S. and number one in the U.K. Furthermore, the record arguably became the first significant country-rock record to be released, setting the stage for efforts by the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers later in 1969. Dylan followed his country inclinations on his next album, 1969&apos;s Nashville Skyline, which was recorded in Nashville with several of the country industry&apos;s top session men. While the album was a hit, spawning the Top Ten single &quot;Lay Lady Lay,&quot; it was criticized in some quarters for uneven material. The mixed reception was the beginning of a full-blown backlash that arrived with the double-album Self Portrait. Released early in June of 1970, the album was a hodgepodge of covers, live tracks, re-interpretations, and new songs greeted with negative reviews from all quarters of the press. Dylan followed the album quickly with New Morning, which was hailed as a comeback.&#xD;&#xA;Following the release of New Morning, Dylan began to wander restlessly. He moved back to Greenwich Village, he finally published Tarantula in November of 1970, and he performed at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. During 1972, he began his acting career by playing Alias in Sam Peckinpah&apos;s Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, which was released in 1973. He also wrote the soundtrack for the film, which featured &quot;Knockin&apos; on Heaven&apos;s Door,&quot; his biggest hit since &quot;Lay Lady Lay.&quot; The Pat Garrett soundtrack was the final record released under his Columbia contract before he moved to David Geffen&apos;s fledgling Asylum Records. As retaliation, Columbia assembled Dylan, a collection of Self Portrait outtakes, for release at the end of 1973. Dylan only recorded two albums -- including 1974&apos;s Planet Waves, coincidentally his first number one album -- before he moved back to Columbia. The Band supported Dylan on Planet Waves and its accompanying tour, which became the most successful tour in rock &amp; roll history; it was captured on 1974&apos;s double live album Before the Flood.&#xD;&#xA;Dylan&apos;s 1974 tour was the beginning of a comeback culminating with 1975&apos;s Blood on the Tracks. Largely inspired by the disintegration of his marriage, Blood on the Tracks was hailed as a return to form by critics and it became his second number one album. After jamming with folkies in Greenwich Village, Dylan decided to launch a gigantic tour, loosely based on traveling medicine shows. Lining up an extensive list of supporting musicians -- including Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Ramblin&apos; Jack Elliott, Arlo Guthrie, Mick Ronson, Roger McGuinn, and poet Allen Ginsberg -- Dylan dubbed the tour the Rolling Thunder Revue and set out on the road in the fall of 1975. For the next year, the Rolling Thunder Revue toured on and off, with Dylan filming many of the concerts for a future film. During the tour, Desire was released to considerable acclaim and success, spending five weeks on the top of the charts. Throughout the Rolling Thunder Revue, Dylan showcased &quot;Hurricane,&quot; a protest song he had written about boxer Rubin Carter, who had been unjustly imprisoned for murder. The live album Hard Rain was released at the end of the tour. Dylan released Renaldo and Clara, a four-hour film based on the Rolling Thunder tour, to poor reviews in early 1978.&#xD;&#xA;Early in 1978, Dylan set out on another extensive tour, this time backed by a band that resembled a Las Vegas lounge act. The group was featured on the 1978 album Street Legal and the 1979 live album At Budokan. At the conclusion of the tour in late 1978, Dylan announced that he was a born-again Christian, and he launched a series of Christian albums that following summer with Slow Train Coming. Though the reviews were mixed, the album was a success, peaking at number three and going platinum. His supporting tour for Slow Train Coming featured only his new religious material, much to the bafflement of his long-term fans. Two other religious albums -- Saved (1980) and Shot of Love (1981) -- followed, both to poor reviews. In 1982, Dylan traveled to Israel, sparking rumors that his conversion to Christianity was short-lived. He returned to secular recording with 1983&apos;s Infidels, which was greeted with favorable reviews.&#xD;&#xA;Dylan returned to performing in 1984, releasing the live album Real Live at the end of the year. Empire Burlesque followed in 1985, but its odd mix of dance tracks and rock &amp; roll won few fans. However, the five-album/triple-disc retrospective box set Biograph appeared that same year to great acclaim. In 1986, Dylan hit the road with Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers for a successful and acclaimed tour, but his album that year, Knocked Out Loaded, was received poorly. The following year, he toured with the Grateful Dead as his backing band; two years later, the souvenir album Dylan &amp; the Dead appeared.&#xD;&#xA;In 1988, Dylan embarked on what became known as &quot;the Never-Ending Tour&quot; -- a constant stream of shows that ran on and off into the late &apos;90s. That same year, he appeared on The Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1 -- by the supergroup also featuring George Harrison, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne -- and released his own Down in the Groove, an album largely comprised of covers. The Never-Ending Tour received far stronger reviews than Down in the Groove (the Traveling Wilburys album fared much better), but 1989&apos;s Oh Mercy was his most acclaimed album since 1975&apos;s Blood on the Tracks, due in part to Daniel Lanois&apos; strong production. However, Dylan&apos;s 1990 follow-up, Under the Red Sky (issued the same year as the second album by the Traveling Wilburys, now a quartet following the death of Roy Orbison shortly after the release of the Wilburys&apos; first long-player in 1988), was received poorly, especially when compared to the enthusiastic reception for the 1991 box set The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased), a collection of previously unreleased outtakes and rarities.&#xD;&#xA;For the remainder of the &apos;90s, Dylan divided his time between live concerts, painting, and studio projects. He returned to recording in 1992 with Good as I Been to You, an acoustic collection of traditional folk songs. It was followed in 1993 by another folk record, World Gone Wrong, which won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album. After the release of World Gone Wrong, Dylan released a greatest-hits album and a live record.&#xD;&#xA;Dylan released Time Out of Mind, his first album of original material in seven years, in the fall of 1997. Time Out of Mind received his strongest reviews in years and unexpectedly debuted in the Top Ten, eventually climbing to platinum certification. Such success sparked a revival of interest in Dylan, who appeared on the cover of Newsweek and began selling out concerts once again. Early in 1998, Time Out of Mind received three Grammy Awards -- Album of the Year, Best Contemporary Folk Album, and Best Male Rock Vocal. Another album of original material, Love and Theft, followed in 2001 and went gold. Soon after its release, Dylan announced that he was making his own film, to star Jeff Bridges, Penelope Cruz, John Goodman, Val Kilmer, and many more. The accompanying soundtrack, Masked and Anonymous, was released in July 2003. Dylan opted to self-produce his new studio album, Modern Times, which topped the Billboard charts and went platinum in both America and the U.K. It was Dylan&apos;s third consecutive album to receive praise from critics and support from consumers, and it was followed three years later in 2009 by Together Through Life, another self-produced effort (as Jack Frost) that also featured contributions from David Hidalgo of Los Lobos and Mike Campbell of Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers. He capped off the year with an old-fashioned holiday effort, Christmas in the Heart. Proceeds from the album were donated to various charities around the world. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/66877/thumb/1445629022" art="/library/metadata/66877/art/1445629022" addedAt="1438445109" updatedAt="1445629022">

  <Directory ratingKey="58046" key="/library/metadata/58046/children" type="artist" title="Bon Jovi" summary="After ushering in the era of pop-metal with their 1986 blockbuster Slippery When Wet and its hit singles âYou Give Love a Bad Name,â âWanted Dead or Alive,â and âLiving on a Prayer,â Bon Jovi wound up transcending the big-haired â80s, withstanding changes in style and sound to become one of the biggest American rock bands of their time, selling over 120 million albums worldwide, and sustaining their popularity well into the new millennium. As the times changed, so did the bandâs sound. They slowly peeled away the arena rock guitars of the â80s, occasionally scoring on the adult contemporary charts and sometimes singing country music without ever rejecting hard rock, a move that illustrated how they never abandoned their roots and became second only to Bruce Springsteen in defining the sound and spirit of New Jersey rock &amp; roll.&#xD;&#xA;Bon Jovi took their name from lead singer Jon Bon Jovi (born Jon Bongiovi), who spent his adolescence playing in local Jersey bands with David Bryan (born David Rashbaum). Jonâs cousin, Tony Bongiovi, owned the celebrated New York recording studio the Power Station and Jon spent many hours there, working as a janitor and recording demos after hours, sometimes supported by members of the E Street Band or Aldo Nova. One of those demos, &quot;Runaway,&quot; became a hit on local New Jersey radio and lead to the formation of Bon Jovi the band, as Jon and Bryan were supported by guitarist Dave Sabo, bassist Alec John Such, and drummer Tico Torres. âRunawayâ spurred a major-label bidding war leading to a contract with Polygram/Mercury in 1983. Before the group entered the studio, though, Bon Jovi replaced Sabo with Richie Sambora, a working guitarist with a long rÃ©sumÃ© including a stint as a member of Message.&#xD;&#xA;Bon Jovi released their eponymous debut album in 1984, generating a Top 40 hit with the original version of &quot;Runaway.&quot; The following year, 7800Â° Fahrenheit was released and went gold, all serving as a prelude to the band&apos;s 1986 breakthrough, Slippery When Wet. Paul Stanley had given Jon and Richie the phone number of professional songwriter Desmond Child, and together they wrote two of the album&apos;s biggest hits in Richie&apos;s parents&apos; basement. The trio composed 30 songs in total and auditioned them for local New Jersey and New York teenagers, basing the album&apos;s running order on their opinions. Supported by several appealing, straightforward videos that received heavy rotation on MTV, the record took off on the strength of âYou Give Love a Bad Name,â followed quickly by âLivinâ on a Prayerâ and âWanted Dead or Alive.â Those three Top Ten Hits helped propel Slippery When Wet to sales of nine million in the U.S. alone, establishing Bon Jovi as superstars in their home country. Their fame was not limited to the U.S., though, as the album also turned into a significant hit in Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia.&#xD;&#xA;Bon Jovi built upon Slippery When Wet&apos;s formula with 1988&apos;s New Jersey, which shot to number one upon its release. New Jersey was only slightly less successful than its predecessor, selling five million copies and generating two number one singles, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; and &quot;I&apos;ll Be There for You,&quot; as well as the Top Ten hits &quot;Born to Be My Baby,&quot; &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me,&quot; and &quot;Living in Sin.&quot; Following the completion of an 18-month international tour, the band went on hiatus. During the time off, Jon Bon Jovi wrote the soundtrack for Young Guns II, which was released in 1990 as the Blaze of Glory album. The record produced two hit singles -- the number one title track and the number 12 &quot;Miracle&quot; -- and earned several Grammy and Oscar nominations. &#xD;&#xA;The following year, Bon Jovi reunited to record their fifth album, Keep the Faith, which was released in the fall of 1992. While the album didn&apos;t match the blockbuster status of its predecessors, it did produce a hit with &quot;Bed of Roses,&quot; an adult contemporary-styled ballad that helped sustain the bandâs popularity. A greatest-hits album called Cross Road appeared in 1994 and yielded another Top Ten ballad, &quot;Always.&quot; Around the same time, bassist Alec John Such left the band; Hugh McDonald, who appeared on Bon Jovi recordings stretching back as far as âRunaway,â became his unofficial replacement and featured prominently on the bandâs next album. Released in the fall of 1995, These Days turned into another U.S. Top Ten, as well as a popular European hit. After appearing in the 1996 film Moonlight and Valentino, Jon Bon Jovi released his first official solo album, Destination Anywhere, in the summer of 1997. &#xD;&#xA;During the tail end of the &apos;90s, the members of Bon Jovi engaged in different projects -- Sambora released a sophomore solo set called Undiscovered Soul in 1998 -- before easing back into work in 1999 via a song for EdTV, then beginning work on a full-length record. The resulting album, Crush, appeared in 2000 and constituted something of a comeback in America thanks to the smash single âItâs My Life,â a cross-platform hit single with long legs. âThank You for Loving Meâ also turned into a hit, helping Crush go double platinum in the U.S. and selling eight million copies worldwide. Bon Jovi quickly followed Crush with their eighth studio effort, Bounce, which appeared in fall 2002, and supported the record with another international tour. In 2003, the band re-recorded many of its most well-known songs for the acoustic-based release This Left Feels Right, which also saw an accompanying DVD in 2004. &#xD;&#xA;The ambitious outtakes and rarities box set 100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can&apos;t Be Wrong arrived later that November, followed by the all-new Have a Nice Day -- the first of several albums produced by John Shanks. That album&apos;s success was aided in part by the single âWho Says You Canât Go Home,â featuring guest vocals from Sugarland&apos;s Jennifer Nettles, which eventually won the Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals --  as well as topping the charts in Japan, Australia, Europe, and Canada. The band spent the following year in the studio, putting the finishing touches on a collection of pop-infused heartland country anthems. The resulting Lost Highway, which featured duets with LeAnn Rimes and Big &amp; Rich, arrived in the summer of 2007 and grabbed the band a healthy new country music fan base in the process. Lost Highway&apos;s cross-genre formula proved to be quite potent, securing the band its third number one album in the U.S. Bon Jovi returned to rock shortly thereafter, though, with the release of the somber, searching The Circle in 2009. One year later, Greatest Hits: The Ultimate Collection offered plenty of hits along with two new tracks, âNo Apologiesâ and âWhat Do You Got?â ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58046/thumb/1445624453" art="/library/metadata/58046/art/1445624453" addedAt="1438457152" updatedAt="1445624453">

  <Directory ratingKey="66745" key="/library/metadata/66745/children" type="artist" title="Bruce Springsteen" summary="In the decades following his emergence on the national scene in 1975, Bruce Springsteen proved to be that rarity among popular musicians, an artist who maintained his status as a frontline recording and performing star, consistently selling millions of albums and selling out arenas and stadiums around the world year after year, as well as retaining widespread critical approbation, with ecstatic reviews greeting those discs and shows. Although there were a few speed bumps along the way in Springsteen&apos;s career, the wonder of his nearly unbroken string of critical and commercial success is that he achieved it while periodically challenging his listeners by going off in unexpected directions, following his muse even when that meant altering the sound of his music or the composition of his backup band, or making his lyrical message overtly political. Of course, it may have been these very sidesteps that kept his image and his music fresh, especially since he always had the fallback of returning to what his fans thought he did best, barnstorming the country with a marathon rock &amp; roll show using his longtime bandmates.&#xD;&#xA;Bruce Springsteen was born September 23, 1949, in Freehold, NJ, the son of Douglas Springsteen, a bus driver, and Adele (Zirilli) Springsteen, a secretary. He became interested in music after seeing Elvis Presley perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956 and obtained a guitar, but he didn&apos;t start playing seriously until 1963. In 1965, he joined his first band, the Beatles-influenced Castiles. They got as far as playing in New York City, but broke up in 1967 around the time Springsteen graduated from high school and began frequenting clubs in Asbury Park, NJ. From there, he briefly joined Earth, a hard rock band in the style of Cream. Also in the hard rock vein was his next group, Child (soon renamed Steel Mill), which featured keyboard player Danny Federici and drummer Vini Lopez. (Later on, guitarist Steve Van Zandt joined on bass.) Steel Mill played in California in 1969, drawing a rave review in San Francisco and even a contract offer from a record label. But they broke up in 1971, and Springsteen formed a big band, the short-lived Dr. Zoom &amp; the Cosmic Boom, quickly superseded by the Bruce Springsteen Band. Along with Federici, Lopez, and Van Zandt (who switched back to guitar), this group also included pianist David Sancious and bassist Garry Tallent, plus a horn section that didn&apos;t last long before being replaced by a single saxophonist, Clarence Clemons. Due to a lack of work, however, Springsteen broke up the band and began playing solo shows in New York City. It was as a solo performer that he acquired a manager, Mike Appel, who arranged an audition for legendary Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond. Hammond signed Springsteen to Columbia in 1972.&#xD;&#xA;In preparing his debut LP, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., Springsteen immediately re-hired most of his backup band, Federici, Lopez, Sancious, Tallent, and Clemons. (Van Zandt, on tour with the Dovells, was mostly unavailable.) The album went unnoticed upon its initial release in January 1973 (although Manfred Mann&apos;s Earth Band would turn its leadoff track, &quot;Blinded by the Light,&quot; into a number one hit four years later, and the LP itself has since gone double platinum). The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle (September 1973) also failed to sell despite some rave reviews. (It too has gone double platinum.) The following year, Springsteen revised his backup group -- now dubbed the E Street Band -- as Lopez and Sancious left, and Max Weinberg (drums) and Roy Bittan (piano) joined. (In 1975, Van Zandt returned to the group.) With this unit he toured extensively while working on the LP that represented his last chance with Columbia. By the time Born to Run (August 1975) was released, the critics and a significant cult audience were with him, and the title song became a Top 40 hit while the album reached the Top Ten, going on to sell six million copies.&#xD;&#xA;Despite this breakthrough, Springsteen&apos;s momentum was broken by a legal dispute, as he split from Appel and brought in Jon Landau (a rock critic who had famously called him the &quot;rock &amp; roll future&quot; in a 1974 concert review) as his new manager. The legal issues took until 1977 to resolve, during which time Springsteen was unable to record. (One beneficiary of this problem was Patti Smith, to whom Springsteen gave the composition &quot;Because the Night,&quot; which, with some lyrical revisions by her, became her only Top 40 hit in the spring of 1978.) He finally returned in June 1978 with Darkness on the Edge of Town. By then, he had to rebuild his career. Record labels had recruited their own versions of the Springsteen &quot;heartland&quot; rock sound, in such similar artists as Bob Seger &amp; the Silver Bullet Band (who actually preceded Springsteen but achieved national recognition in his wake), Johnny Cougar (aka John Mellencamp), Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, Meat Loaf, Eddie Money, and even fellow Jersey Shore residents Southside Johnny &amp; the Asbury Jukes, to name only some of the more successful ones. At the same time, the punk/new wave trend had become the new focus of critical devotion, making Springsteen seem unfashionable. Notwithstanding these challenges, Darkness earned its share of good reviews and achieved Top Ten status, selling three million copies as the single &quot;Prove It All Night&quot; hit the Top 40. (In early 1979, the Pointer Sisters took Springsteen&apos;s composition &quot;Fire&quot; into the Top Ten.)&#xD;&#xA;Springsteen fully consolidated his status with his next album, the two-LP set The River (October 1980), which hit number one, sold five million copies, and spawned the Top Ten hit &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; and the Top 40 hit &quot;Fade Away.&quot; (In 1981-1982, Gary U.S. Bonds reached the Top 40 with two Springsteen compositions, &quot;This Little Girl&quot; and &quot;Out of Work.&quot;) But having finally topped the charts, Springsteen experimented on his next album, preferring the demo recordings of the songs he had made for Nebraska (September 1982) to full-band studio versions, especially given the dark subject matter of his lyrics. The stark LP nevertheless hit the Top Ten and sold a million copies without benefit of a hit single or a promotional tour. (Van Zandt amicably left the E Street Band for a solo career at this point and was replaced by Nils Lofgren.)&#xD;&#xA;But then came Born in the U.S.A. (June 1984) and a two-year international tour. The album hit number one, threw off seven Top Ten hits (&quot;Dancing in the Dark,&quot; which earned Springsteen his first Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, &quot;Cover Me,&quot; &quot;Born in the U.S.A.,&quot; &quot;I&apos;m on Fire,&quot; &quot;Glory Days,&quot; &quot;I&apos;m Goin&apos; Down,&quot; and &quot;My Hometown&quot;), and sold 15 million copies, putting Springsteen in the pop heavens with Michael Jackson and Prince. For his next album, he finally exploited his reputation as a live performer by releasing the five-LP/three-CD box set Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band Live/1975-85 (November 1986), which topped the charts, was certified platinum 13 times, and spawned a Top Ten hit in a cover of Edwin Starr&apos;s &quot;War.&quot; (In March 1987, &quot;the Barbusters&quot; -- actually Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts, took Springsteen&apos;s composition &quot;Light of Day,&quot; written for the movie of the same name, into the Top 40.)&#xD;&#xA;Characteristically, Springsteen returned to studio work with a more introverted effort, Tunnel of Love (October 1987), which presaged his 1989 divorce from his first wife, actress Julianne Phillips. (He married a second time to singer/songwriter/guitarist Patti Scialfa, who had joined the E Street Band in 1991.) The album was another number one hit, selling three million copies and producing two Top Ten singles, &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; and the title song, as well as the Top 40 hit &quot;One Step Up.&quot; The album earned him a second male rock vocal Grammy. (In the spring of 1988, Natalie Cole covered the Springsteen B-side &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; for a Top Ten hit.)&#xD;&#xA;Springsteen retreated from public view in the late &apos;80s, breaking up the E Street Band in November 1989. He returned to action in March 1992 with a new backup band, simultaneously releasing two albums, Human Touch and Lucky Town, which entered the charts at numbers two and three, respectively, each going platinum. A double-sided single combining &quot;Human Touch&quot; and &quot;Better Days&quot; was a Top 40 hit. Of course, this was a relative fall-off from the commercial heights of the mid-&apos;80s, but Springsteen was undeterred. He next contributed the moody ballad &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot; to the soundtrack of Philadelphia, film director Jonathan Demme&apos;s 1993 depiction of a lawyer fighting an unjust termination for AIDS. The recording became a Top Ten hit, and the song went on to win Springsteen four Grammys (Song of the Year, Best Rock Song, best song written for a motion picture or television, and another for male rock vocal) and the Academy Award for best song.&#xD;&#xA;In early 1995, Springsteen reconvened the E Street Band to record a few new tracks for his Greatest Hits (February 1995). The album topped the charts and sold four million copies, with one of the new songs, &quot;Secret Garden,&quot; eventually reaching the Top 40. Despite this success, Springsteen resisted the temptation to reunite with the E Street Band on an ongoing basis at this point, instead recording another low-key, downcast, near-acoustic effort in the style of Nebraska, The Ghost of Tom Joad (November 1995) and embarking on a solo tour to promote it. The LP won a Grammy for best contemporary folk album, but it missed the Top Ten and only went gold.&#xD;&#xA;A much more prolific songwriter and recording artist than what was reflected in his legitimately released discography, Springsteen went into his vault of unreleased material and assembled the four-CD box set Tracks (November 1998), which went platinum. Whether inspired by the playing he heard on those recordings, bowing to constant fan pressure, or simply recognizing the musicians with whom he had made his most successful music, Springsteen finally reunited the E Street Band in 1999, beginning with a performance at his induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. All the members from the 1974-1989 edition of the group returned. (Characteristically, Springsteen sidestepped the question of whether to use Van Zandt or Lofgren in the guitar position by rehiring both of them.) They embarked on a world tour that lasted until mid-2000, its final dates resulting in the album Live in New York City, which hit the Top Ten and sold a million copies.&#xD;&#xA;Springsteen&apos;s writing process in coming up with a new rock album to be recorded with members of the E Street Band was given greater impetus in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the resulting disc, The Rising (July 2002), contained songs that reflected on the tragedy. The album hit number one and sold two million copies, winning the Grammy for rock album, as the title song won for rock song and male rock vocal. Following another lengthy tour with the E Street Band, Springsteen again returned to the style and mood of Nebraska on another solo recording, Devils &amp; Dust (April 2005), taking to the road alone to promote it. The album hit number one and went gold, winning a Grammy for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. One year later, Springsteen unveiled another new musical approach when he presented We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (April 2006), an album on which he played new arrangements of folk songs associated with Pete Seeger, played by a specially assembled Sessions Band. The album reached the Top Ten and went gold as Springsteen toured with the group. It also won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album. The tour led to a concert recording, Live in Dublin (June 2007), which reached the Top 40.&#xD;&#xA;Once again, Springsteen recorded a new rock album, Magic (October 2007), as a precursor to re-forming the E Street Band and going out on another long tour. The album hit number one and went platinum, with the song &quot;Radio Nowhere&quot; earning Grammys for rock song and solo rock vocal. (Another track from the album, &quot;Girls in Their Summer Clothes,&quot; won the rock song Grammy the following year.) Sadly, longtime E Street Band keyboardist Danny Federici succumbed to a three-year battle with melanoma on April 17, 2008, his death causing the first irrevocable change in the group&apos;s personnel (saxophonist Clarence Clemons would die on June 18, 2011 due to complications from a stroke). Federici was replaced by Charles Giordano who had played with Springsteen previously in the Sessions Band.&#xD;&#xA;Springsteen finished the tour in 2008 and held several additional shows in support of Senator Barack Obama, whose presidential campaign had kicked into hyperdrive earlier that year. While playing an Obama rally in early November, Springsteen debuted material from his forthcoming album, Working on a Dream, whose tracks had been recorded with the E Street Band during breaks in the group&apos;s previous tour. The resulting album, which was the last to feature contributions from Federici (as well as his son, Jason), arrived on January 27, 2009, one week after Obama&apos;s historic inauguration. It immediately hit number one, Springsteen&apos;s ninth album to top the charts over a period of three decades, and it went on to win him another Grammy for solo rock vocal and to go gold. In February, Springsteen and the E Street Band provided the half-time entertainment at Super Bowl XLIII. The group&apos;s tour, which featured full-length performances of some of Springsteen&apos;s classic albums at selected shows, ran through November 22, 2009. In December, the 60-year-old was ranked fourth among the top touring acts of the first decade of the 21st century, behind only the Rolling Stones, U2, and Madonna. The same month he was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors. ~ William Ruhlmann" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/66745/thumb/1445629005" art="/library/metadata/66745/art/1445629005" addedAt="1438445159" updatedAt="1445629005">

A veteran of the &apos;70s studio arena rock game, Adams struck out on his own in the early &apos;80s, turning into a star in his native Canada and making headway with his 1983 album, Cuts Like a Knife. All of this was a prelude to Reckless, the 1984 album that turned him into an international superstar, selling by the truckloads in North America, Europe, and Asia thanks to the hits &quot;Run to You,&quot; &quot;Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Summer of &apos;69.&quot; From that point on, Adams was the most unassuming of rock stars, riding high on the charts and selling out arenas, even breaking Billboard records with his power ballad &quot;Everything I Do (I Do It for You),&quot; but never quite dominating the public imagination (or earning the critical respect) as such peers as Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp. Nevertheless, Adams remained a formidable presence on the American charts into the mid-&apos;90s, and while the popularity of his new records started to slip after that, he retained his audience in Canada and the U.K. and his &apos;80s hits remained radio staples as he began a career as a photographer.&#xD;&#xA;The son of an English diplomat, Bryan Adams was born in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in 1959 and spent much of his childhood traveling Europe. His family set down roots in North Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1973, around which time he began seriously pursuing music, quickly getting into the thick of Vancouver&apos;s scene. Adams quit school and wound up as a replacement for Nick Gilder in the glam rock band Sweeney Todd, singing lead on the band&apos;s second album, If Wishes Were Horses..., when he was just 15. Not long after its 1977 release, Adams left the group and began his long, fruitful collaboration with Jim Vallance, then currently the drummer of Prism but looking to move into songwriting. The pair clicked and they soon assembled a demo tape for Adams, a tape that earned the singer a contract with A&amp;M Records in 1978. Two years later, Adams&apos; eponymous debut appeared in Canada, where it did respectably. A year later, his second album, the Bob Clearmountain-produced You Want It, You Got It, started to get Adams some play on album rock radio stations, a development that led to Adams and Vallance co-writing two songs with Gene Simmons for Kiss&apos; 1982 LP, Creatures of the Night.&#xD;&#xA;Things started to break wide open for Adams in 1983 thanks to Cuts Like a Knife, an album that had a big, powerful album rock sound and the pop hooks that would later turn him into a star. The former could be heard on the singles &quot;Cuts Like a Knife&quot; and &quot;This Time,&quot; while the latter was in bloom on the ballad &quot;Straight from the Heart,&quot; the song that became Adams&apos; first American Top Ten hit. It all paved the way for Reckless, the 1984 album that turned Adams into a superstar. Reckless had the right songs -- particularly the brooding minor-key &quot;Run to You,&quot; the skyscraping power ballad &quot;Heaven,&quot; and the nostalgic heartland rocker &quot;Summer of &apos;69,&quot; but also the Tina Turner duet &quot;It&apos;s Only Love,&quot; &quot;Somebody,&quot; and &quot;One Night Love Affair,&quot; all released as singles, meaning that over half the album was released as singles in true Thriller fashion -- at the right time, all given videos that earned heavy rotation on MTV. As Adams supported the album with an international tour that lasted nearly two years, he surfaced in other ways: opening the American concert in Live Aid; co-writing Canada&apos;s Ethiopian famine relief charity single &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;; and working steadily with Vallance on tunes for a number of other artists, including Loverboy, Roger Daltrey, Neil Diamond, Bonnie Raitt, and Glass Tiger, whose Adams/Vallance-written song &quot;Don&apos;t Forget Me (When I&apos;m Gone)&quot; featured Adams on backing vocals.&#xD;&#xA;Adams succeeded Reckless in 1987 with Into the Fire, a bigger streamlined record that ironically didn&apos;t produce a huge hit; &quot;Heat of the Night&quot; and &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; reached the Top Ten, but they didn&apos;t cut into public consciousness the way the singles from its predecessor did, and the album plateaued at platinum. In the wake of this lukewarm reception, Adams parted ways with Vallance -- their last notable collaboration was Joe Cocker&apos;s 1989 hit &quot;When the Night Comes,&quot; co-written with Diane Warren -- and teamed with producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, who had recently helmed Def Leppard&apos;s 1987 blockbuster Hysteria, for his next album, Waking Up the Neighbours. In spite of its rabble-rousing title, Waking Up the Neighbours wasn&apos;t a big rock &amp; roll album, something its smash hit &quot;Everything I Do (I Do It for You)&quot; made plain. Written as the theme for the Kevin Costner film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, the power ballad -- co-written by Adams, Lange, and the film&apos;s composer, Michael Kamen -- was Adams&apos; biggest hit, spending seven weeks at the top of the U.S. Billboard charts, an impressive stretch overshadowed only by its astonishing 16-week run at the top of the British charts, a feat that smashed all U.K. records. In the wake of this remarkable success, Waking Up the Neighbours appeared in September 1991, soon turning into Adams&apos; second-biggest hit album, spawning the Top Ten hit &quot;Can&apos;t Stop This Thing We Started&quot; in addition to three other singles, &quot;There Will Never Be Another Tonight,&quot; &quot;Do I Have to Say the Words,&quot; and &quot;Thought I&apos;d Died and Gone to Heaven.&quot; For as successful as the album was in America, it performed better in Europe, beginning a pattern that would only increase over the course of the &apos;90s. &#xD;&#xA;Upon the conclusion of the two-year supporting tour for Waking Up the Neighbours, Adams released his first hits collection, So Far So Good, in time for the 1993 Christmas season; its new song, a power ballad called &quot;Please Forgive Me,&quot; was another Top Ten hit. Not on the album was &quot;All for Love,&quot; a song Adams co-wrote with Lange and Kamen and sang with Rod Stewart and Sting for the film The Three Musketeers; like &quot;Everything I Do (I Do It for You)&quot; before it, the song turned into a massive international hit, topping the U.S. charts in early 1994. As Adams worked on his next album with Lange, &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman&quot; -- another Adams/Lange/Kamen movie tie-in power ballad, this time from the Marlon Brando/Johnny Depp romantic comedy Don Juan DeMarco -- went to number one in the U.S. during the summer of 1995. His next album, 18 Til I Die, finally appeared in the summer of 1996, and while it performed very well in England, Canada, and Europe, thanks to the singles &quot;The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You&quot; and &quot;Let&apos;s Make a Night to Remember,&quot; it stalled in the U.S., failing to reach the Top Ten even though it did manage to go platinum. Toward the end of his tour for the album, Adams performed on MTV&apos;s Unplugged in September 1997, releasing an album of the occasion in December.&#xD;&#xA;Adams parted ways with Mutt Lange for 1998&apos;s On a Day Like Today. The decision turned out to be somewhat ironic, as the album was his hardest-rocking effort in years, something that would seem to have fit Lange&apos;s specialty. The record continued Adams&apos; downward trend in the U.S., peaking at a mere 102, but performed respectably in the U.K., thanks in part to his duet with the Spice Girls&apos; Melanie C on &quot;When You&apos;re Gone.&quot; Another hits compilation, The Best of Me, appeared internationally in 1999, and Adams spent the first years of the new millennium rather quietly, working steadily as a photographer and landing spreads in such major publications as Vanity Fair and Esquire. He published his first collection of photos, Made in Canada, in 1999, followed by Haven in 2000. Another collection, American Women, appeared in 2005. &#xD;&#xA;Musically, he resurfaced on Chicane&apos;s 2000 dance hit &quot;Don&apos;t Give Up&quot; and collaborated with Hans Zimmer for the score to the 2002 animated feature Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron; from that soundtrack, Adams had a minor adult contemporary hit in &quot;Here I Am.&quot; Adams finally released Room Service, his first new album of the decade, in 2005; it, like its predecessor, didn&apos;t have much an impact in the U.S. but did fine overseas. A double-disc hits collection called Anthology also appeared that year, peaking at number 65 in Billboard. In 2006, Adams received a Golden Globe nomination for &quot;Never Gonna Break My Faith,&quot; the song he wrote -- and Mary J. Blige and Aretha Franklin performed -- for Emilio Estevez&apos;s film Bobby. Two years later, he released his 11th album, aptly titled 11, which initially appeared in the U.S. under an exclusive license with Wal-Mart. It was his best-charting studio album in America since 1996, peaking at number 80, and it paved the way for another North American tour, this one featuring stripped-down, acoustic renditions of Adams&apos; biggest hits. The shows stretched into 2010, during which time Adams continued to make additional headlines for his work as a celebrity photographer. Later that year, he released Bare Bones, a live album taken from his acoustic tour. ~ Steven Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63857/thumb/1445626912" art="/library/metadata/63857/art/1445626912" addedAt="1438455672" updatedAt="1445626912">

  <Directory ratingKey="58701" key="/library/metadata/58701/children" type="artist" title="The Cardigans" titleSort="Cardigans" summary="One of the most pleasing pop groups of the &apos;90s, the Cardigans specialized in sugary confections that would grow annoying very quickly if they weren&apos;t backed by solid musicianship and clever arrangements. The band&apos;s 1995 breakout album, Life, reflected the Cardigans at their most saccharine -- the sunny disposition of vocalist Nina Persson being the major argument in favor -- and critics inserted the group into the space age pop revivalist camp. The Cardigans later proved that they were more difficult to pigeonhole, however.&#xD;&#xA;Even the band&apos;s origins showed that their later appearance was quite misleading; two heavy metal fanatics formed the group in October 1992 in Jonkoping, Sweden. Guitarist Peter Svensson met bassist Magnus Sveningsson in a hardcore group, though he had previously trained in music theory and jazz arranging. The two later grew tired of metal and decided to form a pop band with vocalist Nina Persson -- an art-school friend who had never sung professionally -- plus keyboard player Lars-Olof Johansson and drummer Bengt Lagerberg.&#xD;&#xA;All five Cardigans moved into a small apartment in 1993 and began recording a demo tape that entered the hands of producer Tore Johansson later that year. He liked what he heard and invited the group to record at his MalmÃ¶ studio. Signed to the dance-oriented Stockholm label, the Cardigans released Emmerdale in May 1994. The single &quot;Rise &amp; Shine&quot; became a hit on Swedish radio soon after the release of the LP, and a readers poll in Sweden&apos;s Slitz magazine voted Emmerdale the best album of 1994.&#xD;&#xA;The Cardigans spent the last half of 1994 touring Europe and recording their second album. A satirical response to their moody debut, Life showed the band at their most upbeat, including an angelic picture of Persson in an ice-skating outfit for the cover. Released in March 1995 -- with several re-recordings of songs from Emmerdale -- the album eventually sold one and a half million copies worldwide and became especially popular in Japan, where it achieved platinum status.&#xD;&#xA;A deal with Minty Fresh gave the Cardigans an American release of Life in spring 1996, and the group played eight sold-out shows in the U.S. that summer. The American major labels began to notice the attention, and Mercury signed them soon after. First Band on the Moon, released in September 1996, de-emphasized the pure pop in favor of abstract arrangements and some rather violent themes. Nevertheless, the infectious single &quot;Lovefool&quot; became a radio hit by early 1997, and First Band on the Moon eventually reached gold status in America, as well as platinum certification in Japan (just three weeks after its release). &#xD;&#xA;Gran Turismo followed in 1998, though it lacked an obvious hit and led to a long hiatus for the band. Finally, the Cardigans returned in 2003 with Long Gone Before Daylight, marking a clear transition with confessional material closer to the singer/songwriter tradition. Super Extra Gravity followed in 2005. ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58701/thumb/1445624648" art="/library/metadata/58701/art/1445624648" addedAt="1438447817" updatedAt="1445624648">

  <Directory ratingKey="57966" key="/library/metadata/57966/children" type="artist" title="Cat Stevens" summary="Cat Stevens, born Steven Demetre Georgiou, was the son of a Swedish mother and a Greek father who ran a restaurant in London. He became interested in folk music and rock &amp; roll in his teens while attending Hammersmith College and in 1965 began performing under the name Steve Adams. Mike Hurst, a former member of the folk-pop group the Springfields, who had become a record producer, heard him and took him into a recording studio to cut his composition &quot;I Love My Dog.&quot; This demo caused Decca Records to sign him under the name Cat Stevens and assign him to its newly formed Deram subsidiary. &quot;I Love My Dog&quot; reached the British charts in October 1966, peaking in the Top 40. Stevens&apos; next single, &quot;Matthew &amp; Son,&quot; entered the charts in January 1967 and just missed getting to number one (in America, it grazed the bottom of the charts). It was another self-written effort, and Stevens&apos; reputation as a writer was further enhanced by the success of his song &quot;Here Comes My Baby,&quot; which was recorded by the Tremeloes and entered the British charts in February, reaching the Top Five. (In America, it peaked just outside the Top Ten.) &#xD;&#xA;Stevens&apos; third single, &quot;I&apos;m Gonna Get Me a Gun,&quot; entered the British charts in March and reached the Top Ten, preceded by his debut album, Matthew &amp; Son, also a Top Ten entry. In May, P.P. Arnold got into the British charts with Stevens&apos; composition &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest,&quot; peaking in the Top 20. (Ten years later, Rod Stewart topped the U.K. charts and reached the U.S. Top 20 with his revival of the song. Sheryl Crow revived it for an American Top 20 hit in 2003.) Stevens&apos; fourth single, &quot;A Bad Night,&quot; was in the charts in August, peaking in the Top 20. That was a disappointment, considering his recent success, and his next records did even worse: &quot;Kitty,&quot; his fifth single, barely made the charts in December, while New Masters, his second album, didn&apos;t chart at all. Even worse, in March 1968, Stevens contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalized for three months. He spent a year recuperating. After the failure of an intended comeback single, &quot;Where Are You,&quot; released in July 1969, he parted ways with Deram. &#xD;&#xA;Disillusioned by his experience in the music business, Stevens began writing more personal, introspective material. He signed a new contract with Island Records and released his third album, Mona Bone Jakon, in April 1970. Drawn from the album, the single &quot;Lady D&apos;Arbanville&quot; was issued in June 1970 and became his third Top Ten hit in the U.K., causing Mona Bone Jakon to chart modestly in July. Stevens&apos; talent as a songwriter for others had not deserted him; in August, Jimmy Cliff entered the British charts with his composition &quot;Wild World,&quot; reaching the Top Ten. With a backlog of material, Stevens had a second Island album, Tea for the Tillerman, out in November; it made the U.K. Top 20. In America, where his Island recordings were licensed to A&amp;M Records, Mona Bone Jakon had not charted, but Tea for the Tillerman marked his American LP chart debut in February 1971, followed shortly by the single release of his own recording of &quot;Wild World,&quot; which appeared on the album; it peaked in the Top 20. With that, Stevens suddenly became a major star in the U.S. Tea for the Tillerman reached the Top Ten and went gold; Mona Bone Jakon finally reached the charts (it was belatedly certified gold in 1976); and Deram reissued Matthew &amp; Son and New Masters as a two-LP set, which also charted. Stevens was hailed as one of the most important figures in the currently popular folk-rock singer/songwriter trend, along with James Taylor, Carole King, and others. &#xD;&#xA;In June 1971, Stevens released a new single, &quot;Moon Shadow,&quot; which made the Top 40 in the U.S. and the U.K. This was followed in September by &quot;Peace Train,&quot; which hit the pop Top Five and reached number one in the easy listening charts in the U.S., just in advance of Stevens&apos; fifth album, Teaser and the Firecat. An immediate gold-record seller, the LP just missed the top of the U.S. charts and hit the Top Five in the U.K. In addition to &quot;Moon Shadow&quot; and &quot;Peace Train,&quot; it contained &quot;Morning Has Broken,&quot; an adaptation of a hymn, which became Stevens&apos; second consecutive easy listening number one and reached the pop Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Deram compiled another collection of juvenilia, Very Young and Early Songs, which peaked in the U.S. Top 100 in early 1972, as did a belated American release of the single &quot;Where Are You.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;Stevens contributed new and old songs to the film Harold and Maude, a black comedy that became a cult success after its release in 1972, though no soundtrack album was released. (The previously unreleased songs from the film finally turned up on his album Footsteps in the Dark: Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 in 1984.) He also toured and worked on his sixth album, Catch Bull at Four. A slightly harder-rocking effort, the LP, released in October 1972, represented Stevens&apos; commercial peak: it hit number one in the U.S. and just missed duplicating that feat in the U.K., earning gold-record status immediately. Different singles from the album were released in the two countries, in the U.S. &quot;Sitting&quot; and in the U.K. &quot;Can&apos;t Keep It In&quot;; both reached the Top 20. &#xD;&#xA;By 1973, Stevens was again beginning to show signs of the strain of being a pop star, even if he didn&apos;t become physically ill. For tax reasons, he left the U.K. for a year and moved to Brazil, but he donated the money he would have paid in taxes to charity. He performed less often and stopped granting interviews. In June, he released a new single, &quot;The Hurt,&quot; which made the U.S. Top 40. It was followed in August by his seventh album, Foreigner, an ambitious effort that featured an entire LP side given over to a musical suite. The record was another massive commercial success, peaking inside the Top Five in the U.S. and U.K. and going gold instantly. His major appearance for the year was a 90-minute performance on the American TV show In Concert in November. &#xD;&#xA;Stevens issued his eighth album, Buddha and the Chocolate Box, in March 1974, preceded by the single &quot;Oh Very Young,&quot; a Top Ten hit. As usual, the album made the U.S. and U.K. Top Five and went gold upon release. In July, Stevens released an independent summer single, a revival of Sam Cooke&apos;s &quot;Another Saturday Night,&quot; and it made the U.S. Top Ten and the U.K. Top 20. In November, A&amp;M extracted &quot;Ready&quot; from Buddha and the Chocolate Box and released it as a single that made the Top 40. Stevens&apos; Greatest Hits LP was released in June 1975 and predictably was a big success, eventually selling over three million copies in the U.S. alone. &quot;Two Fine People,&quot; a new song featured on it, reached the American Top 40. Stevens had his ninth regular album release, Numbers, ready by November. As if in acknowledgment that his greatest hits were now behind him, the album only made the Top 20 in the U.S., though it was certified gold within a couple of months, did not generate a Top 40 single, and missed the charts entirely in the U.K. Stevens took 18 months to deliver his tenth album, Izitso, in May 1977. It restored some of his commercial clout, hitting the U.S. Top Ten and being certified gold in a month, while reaching the U.K. Top 20, and the single &quot;(Remember the Days of The) Old School Yard&quot; made the Top 40 in America and charted in Great Britain. &#xD;&#xA;On December 23, 1977, Stevens formally became a Muslim and adopted the name Yusuf Islam. Notwithstanding this change, there was an 11th and final Cat Stevens album, Back to Earth, released in December 1978; it sold modestly. With that, Yusuf Islam announced his retirement from the pop music business. He entered into an arranged marriage that eventually produced five children, auctioned off his possessions, and founded a Muslim school near London. He was not widely heard from for another ten years, until he made news at the end of the &apos;80s by commenting on the Ayatollah Khomeini&apos;s fatwa against novelist Salman Rushdie for writing the book The Satanic Verses. Islam later explained he was not calling for Rushdie&apos;s death but that he was defining Islamic law in the same way a Bible student would &quot;quote the legal punishment of a person who commits blasphemy in the Bible.&quot; Still, &quot;classic rock&quot; radio stations discontinued playing him as a result, and 10,000 Maniacs, who had covered &quot;Peace Train&quot; on their In My Tribe album in 1987, had it removed from the record. In 1990 the compilation album The Very Best of Cat Stevens reached the U.K. Top Five. A different album with the same title charted in the U.S. in the spring of 2000 as Yusuf Islam undertook a promotional tour in connection with the reissues of remastered versions of his Cat Stevens albums. Then in 2006, nearly 30 years after the final Cat Stevens studio album, Islam released a new studio effort, An Other Cup. In early 2009 he collaborated with &quot;fifth Beatle&quot; Klaus Voormann for a cover version of George Harrison&apos;s &quot;The Day the World Gets &apos;Round.&quot; All proceeds from the song were donated to a charity to help the children of war-torn Gaza. Later that same year he released the album Roadsinger. ~ William Ruhlmann" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/57966/thumb/1445624380" art="/library/metadata/57966/art/1445624380" addedAt="1438455376" updatedAt="1445624380">

  <Directory ratingKey="63839" key="/library/metadata/63839/children" type="artist" title="Celine Dion" summary="Rising from humble beginnings in the small town of Charlemagne, Quebec, Celine Dion became one of the biggest international stars in pop music history, selling more than 100 million albums worldwide. The youngest in Adhemar and Therese Dion&apos;s family of 14 children, Dion grew up in an environment full of the inherent chaos and material austerity that comes with such a large working-class family. However, the Dion household was also one filled with love for children and music, and her parents and siblings were important figures in the early development of her singing career. Celine began singing in her parents&apos; piano bar when she was just five years old. By the age of 12 she had written one of her first songs, &quot;Ce N&apos;etait Qu&apos;un RÃªve&quot; (&quot;It Was Only a Dream&quot;), which she recorded with the help of her mother and brother and shipped off to a manager named RenÃ© AngÃ©lil, whose name they found on the back of an album by Ginette Reno, a popular Francophone singer. After weeks with no response from AngÃ©lil, Celine&apos;s brother Michel phoned him and said, &quot;I know you haven&apos;t listened to the tape, because if you had, you would&apos;ve called right away.&quot; AngÃ©lil dug up the tape and called the family back the same day to set up a meeting with Celine. When the 12-year-old performed in his office in Montreal, AngÃ©lil cried and set in motion the process of making her a QuÃ©bÃ©cois, and later, an international, star. He mortgaged his house to pay for her first two albums, producing a local number one single. In 1983 she became the first Canadian to have a gold record in France and she won a gold medal at the Yamaha songwriting competition in Japan. Her worldwide reputation was in the making, but success in the United States was not yet forthcoming. &#xD;&#xA;When she was 18, Dion saw Michael Jackson performing on television and told AngÃ©lil that she wanted to be a star like him. AngÃ©lil&apos;s response was to order her to take 18 months off to remake her image. Dion underwent a physical transformation, cutting her hair, plucking her eyebrows, and having her teeth capped to cover up the incisors that had caused a Quebec humor magazine to dub her &quot;Canine Dion.&quot; She was also sent off to English school to polish the language that would help her to break into the American market. When she emerged from this process, she had made an amazing transformation from teen star to adult chanteuse. The payoff came almost immediately. Her 1990 breakthrough album, Unison, was released in the U.S. by Epic Records and produced several hit songs, but it was her duet with Peabo Bryson on the theme song of Disney&apos;s Beauty &amp; the Beast that was her true breakthrough. &#xD;&#xA;&quot;Beauty &amp; the Beast&quot; reached number one on the pop charts and won both a Grammy and Academy award. The song was also featured on her second English album, 1992&apos;s Celine Dion, which launched another Top Ten American hit with &quot;If You Asked Me To,&quot; while spawning two additional Top 40 singles, &quot;Nothing Broken But My Heart&quot; and &quot;Love Can Move Mountains.&quot; During this time there were also important developments in Dion&apos;s personal life. In 1988, AngÃ©lil crossed the line from manager to romantic partner when he kissed Dion one night after a show in Dublin. Fearful that fans would find the 26-year difference in their ages unsettling, the couple kept their relationship a secret for several years. But their 1994 wedding in Montreal&apos;s Notre Dame Basilica was celebrated not only by the 250 invited guests, but by millions of fans worldwide.&#xD;&#xA;One of the hardest-working stars in show business, Dion continued to record and perform on a schedule that would kill most people. She recorded six albums between 1992 and 1996, when her album Falling Into You took her to a new level of stardom. The recording was a runaway hit, winning Grammys for both Album of the Year and Best Pop Album. 1996 also brought her another honor; she was asked to perform at the opening ceremonies of the Atlanta Olympics. Dion&apos;s longest tenure on the pop charts would come the following year, however, when she recorded &quot;My Heart Will Go On,&quot; the theme song for James Cameron&apos;s blockbuster movie Titanic. &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; became omnipresent on the radio as Titanic fever swept the world, and when it was featured on her album Let&apos;s Talk About Love, it helped propel that recording to the top of the charts. By then, Dion had the power to gather a supporting cast of stars, and the album contained an amazing collection of artists, including Barbra Streisand, Luciano Pavarotti, and the Bee Gees. The album would win a host of awards and bring Dion a whole new world of fans.&#xD;&#xA;Her appearance on VH1&apos;s Divas Live special with Aretha Franklin, Gloria Estefan, Mariah Carey, and Shania Twain proved popular as well and helped solidify Dion&apos;s position, not only among contemporary female pop singers but historical greats like Franklin. The continuing popularity of her recordings and live performances made her 1999 sabbatical seem like a tragedy to her fans, but Dion needed a break after more than a decade and a half at a breakneck pace. In 1999, her husband AngÃ©lil was diagnosed with throat cancer. While the disease responded well to treatment and went into remission, the illness was a wake-up call for Dion, who decided to put a new emphasis on her family life and announced a temporary retirement so that she could spend more time at home and have a child. After undergoing fertility treatments, she gave birth to a son in January 2001. The Collector&apos;s Series, Vol. 1 was released during Dion&apos;s hiatus; it featured many of her best-loved songs, as well as a Spanish-language version of &quot;All by Myself.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;Dion returned to the public eye in a big way in March 2002 with A New Day Has Come. The album debuted at number one in over 17 countries, and was accompanied by a full-scale media blitz. But Dion&apos;s greatest challenge was yet to come. Despite millions of albums sold, the adoration of fans worldwide, and the validation of her peers, Dion&apos;s success was still hampered by image problems that had dogged her since the days of &quot;Canine Dion.&quot; While many Americans adored her, just as many snickered at her QuÃ©bÃ©cois heritage and the relative unorthodoxy of her marriage. There was also the issue of her relevancy to lucrative audiences existing outside of her pop vocal constituency. To combat these issues, Dion and her management made a series of bold moves that attempted to solidify her career and ensure its continuity as she entered her mid-thirties. &#xD;&#xA;In early 2002, Dion announced a three-year, 600-show contract to appear five nights a week in an entertainment extravaganza at Caesar&apos;s Palace, Las Vegas, called A New Day. The production would take place in a custom-built, 4,000-seat theater and would feature Dion as the centerpiece of a multimedia program designed and orchestrated by Franco Dragone, the Belgian theater impresario behind the modern circus phenomenon Cirque du Soleil. The project united Dion, her label Sony Music, Dragone&apos;s production company Creations du Dragon, Caesar&apos;s parent Park Place Entertainment, and promoter Concerts West in a landmark multi-million-dollar alliance that hinged on Dion&apos;s ability to put fans in seats five nights a week for three years. In conjunction with the rollout of A New Day was an endorsement deal with German automaker DaimlerChrysler AG worth additional millions. The campaign placed Dion in a series of black-and-white advertisements promoting the stylish allure of Chrysler&apos;s line of upscale automobiles. &#xD;&#xA;The performer also recorded a brand-new song to accompany the spots. Debuting in early 2003, the campaign dovetailed into the March release of One Heart, Dion&apos;s first album since 2001&apos;s A New Day Has Come, which in turn heralded the opening of A New Day on March 25, 2003. That live Las Vegas show was documented on the summer 2004 release New Day: Live in Las Vegas, which was followed a few months later by Miracle, a collection of family songs designed as a tandem book/CD project between Dion and photographer Anne Geddes. The two-CD compilation On Ne Change Pas appeared in 2005, featuring her most popular French-language songs and a new collaboration with the operatic pop vocal foursome Il Divo, &quot;I Believe in You (Je Crois en Toi).&quot; A new French-language album, D&apos;Elles, arrived in May 2007 and debuted at the top of the Canadian album chart. In November of that same year, Dion released the English-language Taking Chances and announced a tour of South Africa and Europe scheduled for 2008. She released the CD/DVD Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert, as well as the documentary DVD Celine: Through the Eyes of the World. A new French album, Sans Attendre, was released in 2012 and, the following year, her English-speaking fans&apos; six-year wait was rewarded with the announcement of the album Loved Me Back to Life. Heralded by its hip-hop-inflected title-track single, the album, released in November, featured duets with Ne-Yo and Stevie Wonder alongside a cover of Daniel Merriweather&apos;s &quot;Water and a Flame.&quot; ~ Stacia Proefrock" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63839/thumb/1445626825" art="/library/metadata/63839/art/1445626825" addedAt="1438449734" updatedAt="1445626825">

  <Directory ratingKey="60776" key="/library/metadata/60776/children" type="artist" title="The Chemical Brothers" titleSort="Chemical Brothers" summary="The act with the first arena-sized sound in the electronica movement, the Chemical Brothers united such varying influences as Public Enemy, Cabaret Voltaire, and My Bloody Valentine to create a dance-rock-rap fusion which rivaled the best old-school DJs on their own terms -- keeping a crowd of people on the floor by working through any number of groove-oriented styles featuring unmissable samples, from familiar guitar riffs to vocal tags to various sound effects. And when the duo (Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons) decided to supplement their DJ careers by turning their bedrooms into recording studios, they pioneered a style of music (later termed big beat) remarkable for its lack of energy loss from the dancefloor to the radio. Chemical Brothers albums were less collections of songs and more hourlong journeys, chock-full of deep bomb-studded beats, percussive breakdowns, and effects borrowed from a host of sources. All in all, the duo proved one of the few exceptions to the rule that intelligent dance music could never be bombastic or truly satisfying to the seasoned rock fan; it&apos;s hardly surprising that they were one of the few dance acts to enjoy simultaneous success in the British/American mainstream and in critical quarters.&#xD;&#xA;While growing up, both Rowlands and Simons grooved to an eccentric musical diet, ranging from the Smiths and Jesus and Mary Chain to Kraftwerk and Public Enemy. They met while taking the same history course at Manchester University, though neither were native Mancunians -- Rowlands enrolled because of the legendary HaÃ§ienda nightclub nearby, while Simons acknowledged the city as birthplace to the Smiths and New Order. The pair began sampling Madchester&apos;s vibrant nightclub scene together during 1989 and 1990, just at the peak of Britain&apos;s fascination with a DJing style named Balearic. Pioneered at the island hot spot of Ibiza during the mid-&apos;80s, Balearic relied on a blend of early house music, Italian disco, rare-groove jazz and funk, Northern soul, hip-hop, and alternative dance. Original Balearic DJs like Trevor Fung, Paul Oakenfold, and Mike Pickering brought the sound back to indie clubs in London and Manchester, and the style proved very attractive to musical eclectics like Rowlands and Simons.&#xD;&#xA;Though Rowlands was already performing in the alternative dance group Ariel, the pair began DJing together at the Manchester club Naked Under Leather in 1991. Hardly believing that their weekend project would progress, they took the semi-serious handle Dust Brothers (a tribute to the American production team responsible for one of their favorite albums, the Beastie Boys&apos; Paul&apos;s Boutique). Despite their doubts, Rowlands and Simons&apos; club night did grow more popular, thanks to the duo&apos;s Balearic mix of rare house tracks flavored with hip-hop breakdowns, independent-dance fusions, and ancient secondhand discards. After deciding to try and re-create their unique sound in their tiny bedroom studio, the Dust Brothers emerged with &quot;Song to the Siren,&quot; an intriguing example of the new alternative dance scene including sample victims Meat Beat Manifesto and This Mortal Coil.&#xD;&#xA;After the single was pressed up on a limited release of 500 copies, it began getting attention from Britain&apos;s top DJs, initially including an old friend named Justin Robertson but later including Andrew Weatherall and Darren Emerson. Weatherall licensed the single to Junior Boy&apos;s Own Records, and after the pair had finished university, they moved back to London to work on another EP (14th Century Sky) and a residency at another club. After their third release, &quot;My Mercury Mouth,&quot; the duo began to get more high-profile clients for remixing: besides Justin Roberston&apos;s Lionrock collective, Primal Scream, the Prodigy, and the Charlatans all received treatments.&#xD;&#xA;When lawyers for the original Dust Brothers came calling in 1995, though, Rowlands and Simons were forced to change to change their name to the Chemical Brothers (the proposed Dust Brothers U.K. was turned down). Word on the street and nightclub scene was so good that it hardly mattered; their new residency at the Heavenly Sunday Social quickly became one of the hottest club nights in England -- documented on the mix disc Live at the Social, Vol. 1 -- and their debut album, Exit Planet Dust, was heavily praised by critics. Another fan of the record, Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher, agreed to lend his vocals to a future single named &quot;Setting Sun,&quot; the Chemicals&apos; tribute to one of their own favorites, the Beatles&apos; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot; The single went to number one in late 1996, and the Chemical Brothers opened up for the giant Oasis concert at Knebworth besides headlining their own shows all over the world.&#xD;&#xA;The Chemical Brothers&apos; second album, Dig Your Own Hole, took charge of the top spot on the album charts upon its release in April 1997, and on the wings of America&apos;s growing electronica push, the album sailed to number 14 stateside and went gold. The duo released a mix album in 1998, Brothers Gonna Work It Out, and followed with their third studio LP, Surrender, in 1999. Rather lackluster expectations sparked a return to the underground with the white-label-only single &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot; and the duo&apos;s fourth album, Come with Us. It too failed to earn the high notices of the first two albums, although after another three-year gap Rowlands and Simons returned with another, 2005&apos;s Push the Button, with guest vocalists Q-Tip, Tim Burgess, Kele Okereke, and the Magic Numbers. The music celebrity parade continued on 2007&apos;s We Are the Night, this time including the Klaxons, Willy Mason, Fatlip, and Midlake. In 2010 they released Further, their first album with no vocal collaborations, while in 2011 they released Hanna, their first film soundtrack. ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60776/thumb/1445625395" art="/library/metadata/60776/art/1445625395" addedAt="1438446487" updatedAt="1445625395">

Bits and pieces of sound, some electronic/samples and some acoustic, but all often heavily effected and/or affected via computer. A few highlights: the 3 &quot;Halliwell Hammers&quot; tracks are the most structured and &quot;song-like&quot;, with their beautiful echoing bell-like melodies and &quot;Bism&quot; is a minimal but roomy ambient track with a gentle white noise and a far away water and calling of birds. Subtle but relaxing, &quot;Worship the Glitch&quot; is not my favorite disc from Coil, but is a welcome addition to my Coil collection that will be listened to every now and then. Very cool mosaic artwork too. As always, this album is unique when compared to Coil&apos;s other work, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s a first cousin of &quot;Time Machines&quot; and &quot;Coil Presents Black Light District: A Thousand Lights in a Darkened Room&quot;, and is similar to various segments of &quot;Unnatural History II&quot; and &quot;Unnatural History II Read more on Last.fm.

  <Directory ratingKey="65764" key="/library/metadata/65764/children" type="artist" title="Coldplay" summary="After surfacing in 2000 with the breakthrough single &quot;Yellow,&quot; Coldplay quickly became one of the biggest bands of the new millennium, honing a mix of introspective Brit-pop and anthemic rock that landed the British quartet a near-permanent residence on record charts worldwide. The group&apos;s emergence was perfectly timed; Radiohead had just released the overly cerebral Kid A, while Oasis had ditched two founding members and embraced psychedelic experimentation on Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. U.K. audiences were hungry for a fresh-faced rock band with big aspirations and an even bigger sound, and Coldplay were more than happy to take the reins. Parachutes went multi-platinum in several countries and earned the band its first Grammy, but Coldplay continued to grow into the 2000s, topping their debut album&apos;s success with higher record sales and an increased public profile.&#xD;&#xA;Chris Martin (vocals/piano), Jon Buckland (guitar), Will Champion (drums), and Guy Berryman (bass) were all born into musical households. Martin, the eldest of five, began playing the piano as a young child and later took solace in the work of Tom Waits. Buckland, on the other hand, grew up with the heavy guitar sounds of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. Scotland native Berryman preferred funk to indie rock, thereby leaving him to play bass, while multi-instrumentalist Champion didn&apos;t plan to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay&apos;s lineup. The bandmates came together in 1996 while attending the University College of London, and the Safety EP was issued shortly after their first gig at a Manchester festival for unsigned bands. The release only saw 500 pressings, as did the subsequent Brothers &amp; Sisters EP. Nevertheless, it was enough to win the band a U.K. deal with Parlophone Records in April 1999, and the five-track Blue Room EP arrived that fall. With nods from the media, Coldplay were hailed as the next Travis, thanks to their simple acoustics and charming personas.&#xD;&#xA;Parlophone ushered Coldplay into Parr St. Studios in Liverpool, where they recorded the bulk of their debut album. Parachutes was released in July 2000 and became a swift hit on the strength of four U.K. singles, several of which enjoyed popularity in America as well. With &quot;Yellow&quot; climbing the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, Parachutes was released in the U.S. in November, where its sales soon rivaled -- and eventually surpassed -- those in the U.K. &#xD;&#xA;Riding on the strength of their universally popular debut, Coldplay headed back into the studio in fall 2001 to work on a sophomore album. They emerged with A Rush of Blood to the Head, releasing the album worldwide in August 2002 and embarking on a global concert tour soon after. &quot;The Scientist&quot; enjoyed regular radio rotation, while both &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;In My Place&quot; won Grammy awards. The CD/DVD package Live 2003 was issued to highlight the group&apos;s popular tour, and Martin specifically earned a higher notch on the celebrity scale by marrying actress Gwyneth Paltrow in December 2003. Paltrow gave birth to the couple&apos;s first daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin, the following April. &#xD;&#xA;Fatherhood didn&apos;t stop Martin from working, as Coldplay began recording material for a third album within weeks. Previously recorded material with longtime producer Ken Nelson was scrapped early on, while Danton Supple (Morrissey, the Cure) joined Coldplay to complete the recording of X&amp;Y. &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; marked Coldplay&apos;s first single from their long-awaited third effort in spring 2005; the album followed in June, topping charts around the world and selling more than eight million copies during its first year. &#xD;&#xA;Such success put Coldplay on the same commercial level as U2, and Coldplay retreated to the studio in late 2006 to work with famed producer Brian Eno (who had teamed up with U2 several times in the past). Recording sessions with Eno were completed within one year, followed by several months of mixing and growing anticipation from the band&apos;s audience. Viva la Vida -- also known by its extended name, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends -- ultimately arrived in June 2008. Worldwide sales for the album had approached six million by November, when Coldplay released several new recordings (including a collaboration with hip-hop mogul Jay-Z) as part of the Prospekt&apos;s March EP. Preceded by first single &quot;Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall,&quot; Coldplay&apos;s fifth studio album, 2011&apos;s Mylo Xyloto, was produced by Markus Dravs, Daniel Green, and Rik Simpson (the official press release adds &quot;with enoxification and additional composition by Brian Eno&quot;).

  <Directory ratingKey="65717" key="/library/metadata/65717/children" type="artist" title="Creedence Clearwater Revival" summary="At a time when rock was evolving further and further away from the forces that had made the music possible in the first place, Creedence Clearwater Revival brought things back to their roots with their concise synthesis of rockabilly, swamp pop, R&amp;B, and country. Though CCR was very much a group in their tight, punchy arrangements, their vision was very much singer, songwriter, guitarist, and leader John Fogerty&apos;s. Fogerty&apos;s classic compositions for Creedence both evoked enduring images of Americana and reflected burning social issues of the day. The band&apos;s genius was their ability to accomplish this with the economic, primal power of a classic rockabilly ensemble. &#xD;&#xA;The key elements of Creedence had been woodshedding in bar bands for about a decade before their breakthrough to national success in the late &apos;60s. John&apos;s older brother Tom formed the Blue Velvets in the late &apos;50s in El Cerrito, CA, a tiny suburb across the bay from San Francisco. By the mid-&apos;60s, with a few hopelessly obscure recordings under their belt, they&apos;d signed to Fantasy, releasing several singles as the Golliwogs that went nowhere. In fact, there&apos;s little promise to be found on those early efforts, primarily because Tom, not John, was doing most of the singing. The group only found themselves when John took firm reins over the band&apos;s direction, singing and writing virtually all of their material. &#xD;&#xA;On their first album Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1968, the group played it both ways, offering extended, quasi-psychedelic workouts of the &apos;50s classics &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; and &quot;Suzie Q.&quot; The latter song became their first big hit, but the band didn&apos;t really bloom until &quot;Proud Mary,&quot; a number-two single in early 1969 that demonstrated John&apos;s talent at tapping into Southern roots music and imagery with a natural ease. It was the start of a torrent of classic hits from the gritty, Little Richard-inspired singer over the next two years, including &quot;Bad Moon Rising,&quot; &quot;Green River,&quot; &quot;Down on the Corner,&quot; &quot;Travelin&apos; Band,&quot; &quot;Who&apos;ll Stop the Rain,&quot; &quot;Up Around the Bend,&quot; and &quot;Lookin&apos; Out My Back Door.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;Creedence also made good albums -- Green River, Willy and the Poor Boys, Cosmo&apos;s Factory all rank among the best of the rock era -- but their true forte was as a singles band. When the Beatles broke up in early 1970, CCR was the only other act that provided any competition in the fine art of crafting bold, super-catchy artistic statements that soared to the upper reaches of the charts every three or four months. Although they hailed from the San Francisco area, they rarely succumbed to the psychedelic indulgences of the era. John Fogerty also proved adept at voicing the concerns of the working class in songs like &quot;Fortunate Son,&quot; as well as partying with as much funk as any white rock band would muster on &quot;Travelin&apos; Band&quot; and &quot;Down on the Corner.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;With John Fogerty holding such a strong upper hand, Creedence couldn&apos;t be said to have been a democratic unit, and Fogerty&apos;s dominance was to sow the seeds of the group&apos;s quick dissolution. Tom Fogerty left in 1971 (recording a few unremarkable solo albums of his own), reducing the band to a trio. John allowed drummer Doug Clifford and bassist Stu Cook equal shares of songwriting and vocal time on the group&apos;s final album, Mardi Gras (1972), which proved conclusively that Fogerty&apos;s songs and singing were necessary to raise CCR above journeyman status. &#xD;&#xA;It was John Fogerty, of course, who produced the only notable work after the quartet broke up. Even his solo outings, though, were erratic and, for nearly ten years, nonexistent as he became embroiled in a web of business disputes with Fantasy Records. His 1984 album Centerfield proved he could still rock in the vintage Creedence mode when the spirit moved him, but Tom Fogerty&apos;s death in 1990 ended any hopes of a CCR reunion with the original members intact. ~ Richie Unterberger" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65717/thumb/1445628499" art="/library/metadata/65717/art/1445628499" addedAt="1438446390" updatedAt="1445628499">

  <Directory ratingKey="63782" key="/library/metadata/63782/children" type="artist" title="Crowded House" summary="An institution in their homeland, a two-hit wonder in the U.S., and, during the last half of their ten-year career, bona fide stars in the U.K. and most of Europe, Crowded House recorded some of the best pop music of the late &apos;80s and early &apos;90s. Leader Neil Finn&apos;s carefully crafted songs, meticulous eye for lyrical detail, and gift for melody are matched by few other songwriters.&#xD;&#xA;Crowded House formed in 1985 when Finn dissolved Split Enz rather than carry on after his brother Tim, the group&apos;s founding member, left to pursue a solo career. Instead of carrying through with the new wave direction of latter-day Split Enz, Neil moved in favor of a stripped-down, back-to-basics combo featuring ex-Enz drummer Paul Hester, bassist Nick Seymour, and guitarist Craig Hooper. Initially, the group dubbed itself after Finn&apos;s middle name, touring Australia and recording demos under the name the Mullanes; Hooper was dropped shortly after this formative period. In June of 1985, the group headed to Los Angeles to shop for a record label, eventually signing with Capitol Records. Capitol requested that the band change its name, and the group settled on Crowded House, a reflection of the bandmembers&apos; living conditions in L.A. They began work on their debut, enlisting the help of then-unknown producer Mitchell Froom. A partnership between the band and the producer formed, making Froom nearly a fourth member. The partnership benefited both the band and the producer -- the band was helped by Froom&apos;s direct approach and more &quot;American&quot; sound as well as his input as a musician, and Froom was able to build a career as a high-profile producer.&#xD;&#xA;Crowded House&apos;s self-titled debut didn&apos;t gain much attention upon its release in the summer of 1986, due to insufficient promotion from Capitol Records. In wake of the weak support from Capitol, the bandmembers took matters into their own hands. Rather than setting out on an expensive large-scale tour, the group took a more low-profile route, playing acoustic sets for industry insiders and for small crowds at ethnic restaurants and in record stores. This unorthodox approach began a buzz within the industry. On the talk-show circuit, they won over American and Canadian audiences with their charm and wit as well as their wacky antics. By February of 1987, the album broke into the American Top 40, eventually peaking at number 12. The album spawned the number two hit single &quot;Don&apos;t Dream It&apos;s Over&quot; and &quot;Something So Strong,&quot; which reached number seven. In Australia and New Zealand, multi-platinum success followed.&#xD;&#xA;Released in 1988, Temple of Low Men was anything but a sophomore slump -- Finn&apos;s new songs were among his finest, showcasing a notable progression in his songcraft. The album&apos;s slightly darker material, however, made for a more difficult listen and, although the material was stronger, the record lacked the immediate appeal of the debut. This, coupled with Capitol&apos;s lack of promotional support, led to disappointing sales -- the album barely broke the U.S. Top 40 and the single, &quot;Better Be Home Soon,&quot; stalled at number 42. Since hope had basically run out for the album, they abandoned plans for a major U.S. tour. A three-month break in touring revitalized the band for a well-received Australian and Canadian tour, but by mid-1989 the band had effectively broken up.&#xD;&#xA;Late in 1989, Neil reunited with his brother Tim and the duo began writing songs together for the first time, with the intention of releasing the material on a proposed Finn Brothers album. The collaboration was successful and the duo was prolific, writing 14 songs in a very short time. After the initial sessions with Tim, Neil began working on a new set of songs, designed for the next Crowded House album, but he soon found the new material unsatisfactory. Neil decided to combine the better moments of the Finn Brothers project and the scrapped third album, adding his brother as a fourth member of Crowded House.&#xD;&#xA;Crowded House&apos;s third album, Woodface, released in the summer of 1991, proved the decision to combine the material from the two scrapped records was sound -- the album certainly represents their finest recorded moments. Although the choice of &quot;Chocolate Cake&quot; as a leadoff single was both misleading and off-putting to American audiences, effectively sinking the album&apos;s chances of success in the U.S., England and Europe embraced the band for the first time. After about six months of dormancy, they began charting in the U.K. and Europe with several singles, including the smash &quot;Weather with You.&quot; The British success of &quot;Weather with You&quot; helped Woodface achieve platinum status in the U.K. and led the group to several headlining concerts at Wembley Arena. Tim, for all of his invaluable contributions in the writing and recording of Woodface, proved extraneous to the band&apos;s live show. He left the band in November 1991, as the band was in the middle of its tour and just prior to its breakthrough success in England. Following the success of Woodface, both Neil and Tim were awarded OBEs from the Queen of England in 1993; the honor was bestowed for their contributions to the arts.&#xD;&#xA;In early 1993, Crowded House regrouped to record their fourth album, adding American guitarist Mark Hart (who had briefly toured with the band around the time of Temple of Low Men) to the band and dropping Mitchell Froom as their producer, opting instead for ex-Killing Joke member Youth. Together Alone was released in October 1993 (January 1994 in North America) to unanimously positive reviews and solid sales in every country except the United States. Upon its release, Together Alone entered the English charts at number four; at the time, Woodface was still in the U.K. charts. After the album was released, Crowded House embarked on a successful European tour. They were beginning an American tour when Hester decided to leave the band to spend more time with his new family. Hiring a session drummer, the band rounded out the tour, eventually returning to Australia.&#xD;&#xA;By the end of 1994, Neil decided to cut back on the touring to work on side projects, which included some production work for Dave Dobbyn and a second try at a Finn Brothers album with Tim. The Finn Brothers finally released their long-awaited duet album in the fall of 1995. In June of 1996, Neil officially broke up Crowded House. That same month, Recurring Dream: The Very Best of Crowded House was released, entering the U.K. and Australian charts at number one. After a handful of &quot;final shows&quot; in various locations, on Sunday, November 24, 1996, Crowded House played their official farewell show at the Sydney Opera House to 100,000 fans as a benefit for the Sydney Children&apos;s Hospital Fund. &#xD;&#xA;In 1997, Hester formed a new band, Largest Living Things, releasing two EPs and playing regular gigs in Australia as well as hosting his own television show. Neil made his debut as a solo artist in June 1998 with Try Whistling This. In December 1999, Afterglow, an album&apos;s worth of Crowded House leftovers and rarities, was issued in Australia and New Zealand; the album was released in the U.K. during January of the following year. &#xD;&#xA;Neil continued recording both as a solo artist and as part of the Finn Brothers with Tim. In 2005, Hester, after years of battling depression, took his own life near his home in Australia. A year later, the archival release Farewell to the World captured the Sydney farewell show on both CD and DVD. In 2007, Neil reactivated the band with Nick Seymour, Mark Hart, and a new drummer, Matt Sherrod. The album Time on Earth followed soon after. In 2010, the Neil and new Crowded House line-up returned with the studio album Intriguer. ~ Chris Woodstra" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63782/thumb/1445626771" art="/library/metadata/63782/art/1445626771" addedAt="1438457316" updatedAt="1445626771">

  <Directory ratingKey="62419" key="/library/metadata/62419/children" type="artist" title="The Cult" titleSort="Cult" summary="Following a succession of name and stylistic changes, the Cult emerged in 1984 as one of England&apos;s leading heavy metal revivalists. Picking up the pseudo-mysticism and Native American obsessions of the Doors, the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin, and the three-chord crunch of AC/DC, while adding touches of post-punk goth rock, the Cult gained a dedicated following in their native Britain with mid-&apos;80s singles like &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; before breaking into the American metal market in the late &apos;80s with &quot;Love Removal Machine.&quot; Though they managed one Top Ten in America with 1989&apos;s Sonic Temple, the Cult were plagued with off-stage tensions and problems that prevented them from retaining their popularity. The band split in 1995 following a pair of unsuccessful records, but returned on an occasional basis for new records -- always anchored by vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy.&#xD;&#xA;The origins of the Cult lie in the Southern Death Cult, a goth rock outfit formed by vocalist Ian Astbury (born May 14, 1962) in 1981. Astbury was the son of a merchant navy man, which meant he moved frequently during his youth; at one point in his childhood, his family lived in Canada, where the young Astbury became fascinated with Native Americans, which would become a recurring theme in his songwriting. Astbury eventually settled in Bradford, Yorkshire, where he met a group comprised of David Burrows (guitar), Barry Jepson (bass), and Haq Quereshi (drums). Ian joined the group as its lead vocalist (performing with the last name of &quot;Lindsay,&quot; which was his mother&apos;s maiden name) and had the group renamed the Southern Death Cult. At only its fifth concert, the band was attracting audiences of 2,000. In December 1982, the Southern Death Cult released their first single -- the double A-side &quot;Moya&quot;/&quot;Fatman&quot; -- and the following month, they supported Bauhaus on tour. Though the group&apos;s future was looking bright, Astbury pulled the plug on the band because he was frustrated with the positive articles he was receiving in the press. The remaining three members joined Getting the Fear, which eventually became Into a Circle; in the late &apos;80s, Quereshi became a member of Fun^Da^Mental. All of the Southern Death Cult recordings were eventually released in 1986.&#xD;&#xA;Following the disbandment of the Southern Death Cult, Astbury shortened the name of the group to Death Cult and recruited guitarist Billy Duffy -- who had previously played with Morrissey in the pre-Smiths band the Nosebleeds, as well as Theatre of Hate -- and drummer Ray Mondo and bassist Jamie Stewart, who had previously played with Ritual. Death Cult released an eponymous EP in the summer of 1983; on the EP, Astbury reverted back to his given name. Later in the year, Mondo was replaced by Nigel Preston, who had previously played with Duffy in Theatre of Hate; coincidentally, Mondo became the drummer for Preston&apos;s previous band, Sex Gang Children.&#xD;&#xA;In early 1984, the bandmembers decided to excise &quot;Death&quot; from the title, fearing that the word gave them the misleading appearance of being a goth band. Where both Southern Death Cult and Death Cult had been overtly influenced by post-punk, the Cult were a heavy hard rock band with slight psychedelic flourishes. Dreamtime, the group&apos;s first album, was released in the fall of 1984, accompanied by the single &quot;Spiritwalker.&quot; Dreamtime reached number 21 on the U.K. charts. In the spring of 1985, Preston left the group. For the group&apos;s summer single, &quot;She Sells Sanctuary,&quot; the band was joined by Big Country&apos;s drummer, Mark Brzezicki. &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; became a major U.K. hit, peaking at number 15. During the recording of the group&apos;s second album, drummer Les Warner joined the group. Love, released in the fall of 1985, continued the hard rock direction of its teaser single and became a number four hit in Britain.&#xD;&#xA;For their third album, the Cult shuffled their lineup -- Stewart moved to rhythm guitar, while former Zodiac Mindwarp bassist Kid Chaos joined the lineup -- and hired Rick Rubin as producer, and the result, Electric, was their hardest, heaviest record to date. The first single from the album, &quot;Love Removal Machine,&quot; became a number 18 hit in the spring of 1987, while the album itself reached number four in the U.K. upon its April release. Later that year, Electric gained the Cult a fan base in America, and the album cracked the U.S. Top 40.&#xD;&#xA;In 1988, the group fired Chaos and Warner, replacing the latter with Matt Sorum; the band failed to hire another bassist. The new lineup released Sonic Temple, which would prove to be the band&apos;s most successful album. The hit single &quot;Fire Woman&quot; helped propel the album into the American Top Ten, and within no time the Cult were seen hanging out with the likes of MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e and Aerosmith, as well as supporting Metallica on the Damaged Justice tour. Though the group was experiencing its best sales, it was fraying behind the scenes, due to infighting and substance abuse. By the time they recorded their follow-up to Sonic Temple, Sorum had left to join Guns N&apos; Roses and Stewart had quit; they were replaced by drummer Mickey Curry and bassist Charlie Drayton. The resulting album, Ceremony, was released in the fall of 1991 to weak reviews and disappointing sales.&#xD;&#xA;Following the release of Ceremony, the group took a break for the next three years. In 1993, the band released the U.K.-only hits compilation Pure Cult, which debuted at number one. By summer 1993, the Cult had a new rhythm section, featuring former Mission bassist Craig Adams and drummer Scott Garrett. This lineup recorded The Cult, which was released in late 1994 to poor reviews and sales. In spring 1995, the Cult disbanded, with Ian Astbury forming the Holy Barbarians later in the year. Billy Duffy briefly played with Miles Hunt&apos;s Vent 414 before leaving to pursue a solo project. In 2000, the band&apos;s catalog was remastered and reissued, and Pure Cult was released in the U.S. (despite a similar compilation, High Octane Cult, having appeared four years earlier). It was followed by Rare Cult, a six-disc box set of rarities. &#xD;&#xA;A new Cult with Matt Sorum and Martyn LeNoble joining Astbury and Duffy made their debut in June 1999 at the Tibetan Freedom Festival. This band produced the 2001 album Beyond Good and Evil before the Cult were retired again, as Astbury joined former Doors members Robbie Krieger and Ray Manzarek in the Doors of the 21st Century (later renamed Riders on the Storm). In 2007, it was announced that Astbury had left the band to rejoin Duffy in a new version of the Cult, with Chris Wyse on bass and John Tempesta on drums. They signed to Roadrunner and released Born into This in 2008, which they promoted over the next few years on their highly publicized Love Live tour. They returned to the studio in 2011 after inking a deal with Cooking Vinyl Records and released their ninth studio album, Choice of Weapon, the following year. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/62419/thumb/1445626115" art="/library/metadata/62419/art/1445626115" addedAt="1438448264" updatedAt="1445626115">

  <Directory ratingKey="65693" key="/library/metadata/65693/children" type="artist" title="Daft Punk" summary="In similar company with new-school French progressive dance artists such as Motorbass, Air, Cassius, and Dimitri from Paris, Parisian duo Daft Punk quickly rose to acclaim by adapting a love for first-wave acid house and techno to their younger roots in pop, indie rock, and hip-hop. The combined talents of DJs Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, the pair&apos;s first projects together included Darling, a voiceless indie cover band; their current recording name derives from a review in U.K. music weekly Melody Maker of a compilation tape Darling were featured on, released by Krautrock revivalists Stereolab (their lo-fi D.I.Y. cover of a Beach Boys song was derided as &quot;daft punk&quot;). Subsequently ditching the almost inevitable creative cul-de-sac of rock for the more appealing rush of the dancefloor, the pair released their debut single, &quot;The New Wave,&quot; in 1993 on the celebrated Soma label. Instantly hailed by the dance music press as the work of a new breed of house innovators, the single was followed by &quot;Da Funk,&quot; the band&apos;s first true hit (the record sold 30,000 copies worldwide and saw thorough rinsings by everyone from Kris Needs to the Chemical Brothers).&#xD;&#xA;Although the group had only released a trio of singles (&quot;The New Wave&quot; and &quot;Da Funk,&quot; as well as the 1996 limited pressing of &quot;Musique&quot;), in early 1996 Daft Punk were the subject of a minor bidding war. The group eventually signed with Virgin, with its first long-player, Homework, appearing early the following year (a brief preview of the album, &quot;Musique,&quot; was also featured on the Virgin compilation Wipeout XL next to tracks from Photek, Future Sound of London, the Chemical Brothers, and Source Direct). As with the earlier singles, the group&apos;s sound is a brazen, dancefloor-oriented blend of progressive house, funk, electro, and techno, with sprinklings of hip-hop-styled breakbeats and excessive, crowd-firing samples similar to other anthemic dance-fusion acts such as the Chemical Brothers and Monkey Mafia. In addition to his role in Daft Punk, Bangalter operates the RoulÃ© label and has recorded under his own name (the underground smash &quot;Trax on da Rocks&quot;) as well as Stardust (the huge club/commercial hit &quot;Music Sounds Better with You&quot;). &#xD;&#xA;After four long years of fans eagerly awaiting a follow-up to their brilliant debut, Daft Punk finally issued Discovery in March 2001. The live record Alive 1997 followed at the end of the year, and a by-now predictable four-year wait preceded the release of Human After All in early 2005. One year later, Daft Punk released a compilation, Musique, Vol. 1: 1993-2005, and in 2007 their second live record, Alive 2007, arrived. The album and its single &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; won Grammy Awards early in 2009; shortly after, it was announced that the duo would compose the soundtrack to Tron: Legacy, the sequel to the 1982 classic sci-fi film Tron. Daft Punk&apos;s music for the movie was released in November 2010, shortly before the film -- which featured the group in a cameo -- arrived in theaters. Early in 2013, Daft Punk announced that they planned to have a new album released by May of that year. That March, the duo announced the album&apos;s title, Random Access Memories, and launched an extensive press campaign that featured snippets of the album&apos;s lead single, &quot;Get Lucky,&quot; and interviews with some of their collaborators, which included Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams, Giorgio Moroder, and Panda Bear. The single was officially released in April, and Random Access Memories arrived in May. ~ Sean Cooper" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65693/thumb/1445628551" art="/library/metadata/65693/art/1445628551" addedAt="1438446416" updatedAt="1445628551">

  <Directory ratingKey="63757" key="/library/metadata/63757/children" type="artist" title="David Gilmour" summary="David Gilmour gained international fame for his incisive, atmospheric guitar work and vocals with Pink Floyd, and eventually became the leader of the group during their late period as well as pursuing a successful solo career and working with some of the most respected names in British rock. Gilmour was born in Cambridge, England on March 6, 1946; his parents were both involved in education -- his father was a lecturer in Zoology at Cambridge University and his mother was a teacher -- and as a schoolboy, Gilmour struck up a friendship with a boy who attended the same grade school, Roger Barrett, who later gained the nickname Syd. Gilmour became re-acquainted with Barrett while they were studying at the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology; both were interested in music and began learning to play guitar in their spare time, as did Barrett&apos;s friend Roger Waters. In 1963, Gilmour joined a rock group, Jokers Wild, which specialized in R&amp;B covers; in 1965, he and Barrett took the summer off and spent several months busking and traveling through France, though the adventure didn&apos;t pay off financially. After returning to England, Gilmour played with a group called Flowers for a while, as well as a revamped version of Jokers Wild called Bullitt; meanwhile, Barrett and Waters teamed up with Rick Wright and Nick Mason to form a group called the Tea Set, which was later renamed Pink Floyd. In 1967, Pink Floyd was the toast of London&apos;s burgeoning psychedelic scene on the strength of the singles &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play,&quot; and the album Piper at the Gates Of Dawn. However, Barrett had become increasingly unstable, sometimes becoming catatonic on-stage or playing different songs than his bandmates, and as his ability to perform was compromised, Gilmour was invited to join the group to help with guitar and vocals when Barrett was having trouble. However, after a few shows it became evident that Gilmour&apos;s presence wasn&apos;t enough to rescue Barrett, and the group&apos;s leader was let go as Gilmour became the band&apos;s new lead guitarist by default, and he would produce and play on Barrett&apos;s two solo albums before Barrett retired from music.&#xD;&#xA;Gilmour made his recording debut with Pink Floyd on 1968&apos;s A Saucerful of Secrets, and over the next several years, the group&apos;s sound evolved from pop-friendly psychedelic to ambitious progressive and experimental rock. Gilmour&apos;s guitar became a key part of Pink Floyd&apos;s aural signature, and he played a larger role in the group&apos;s songwriting; their evolving approach culminated with 1973&apos;s The Dark Side of the Moon, which became a massive international hit and firmly established them as one of the biggest British acts of the day. Pink Floyd&apos;s success continued with 1975&apos;s Wish You Were Here, but as Waters began to dominate the group&apos;s songwriting and conceptualizing, Gilmour began looking for other opportunities to express himself. He&apos;d already made guest appearances on albums by Roy Harper and Hawkwind, and during the recording of 1977&apos;s Animals, Gilmour began work on his first solo album, released in 1978 simply as David Gilmour. In 1978, he also co-produced Kate Bush&apos;s debut album, The Kick Inside, and he contributed guitar work to Wings&apos; 1979 release Back to the Egg. 1979&apos;s The Wall became another massive success for Pink Floyd, and Gilmour co-wrote the stand-out track &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; but tensions within the group grew during the recording of the album -- Rick Wright was fired during the sessions -- and after the long sessions which produced 1983&apos;s The Final Cut, Pink Floyd briefly fell apart. &#xD;&#xA;Following the band&apos;s splintering, Gilmour released his second solo album, 1984&apos;s About Face, and he lent his talents as a guitarist to a number of projects, including albums by Paul McCartney, Bryan Ferry, Pete Townshend, and Supertramp, and produced the debut album for the Dream Academy. Waters made his solo debut with 1984&apos;s The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, and he filed a lawsuit to dissolve the Pink Floyd&apos;s legal partnership. However, the court found in favor of Gilmour and Nick Mason, and in 1987, Gilmour became Pink Floyd&apos;s new leader and principal songwriter as he relaunched the band with the album A Momentary Lapse of Reason. Pink Floyd supported the album with a successful extended tour -- their first since a small handful of elaborate shows following The Wall -- and a live album from the shows, Delicate Sound of Thunder, was released in 1988. After coming off the road, Gilmour stayed busy with session work, making guest appearances with acts as diverse as Warren Zevon and Elton John, while writing material for the next Pink Floyd effort. While a few new pieces appeared on 1992&apos;s La Carrera Panamerica, a video documenting Gilmour and Nick Mason&apos;s participation in an auto race in Mexico, Pink Floyd&apos;s next full album, The Division Bell, didn&apos;t appear until 1994. Once again, a major international tour followed the new studio effort, and on many dates they performed The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety, along with other material from their catalog; one such concert was documented on the 1995 live album Pulse. An archival album drawn from Pink Floyd&apos;s performances of The Wall in 1980 and 1981 appeared in 2000, but no new material appeared. Gilmour reunited with Waters, Mason, and Wright for a one-off Pink Floyd performance at the 2005 Live 8 concert in London (a benefit to promote solutions to global poverty), but the band turned down lucrative offers for a new tour, and in 2006, Gilmour told reporters that Pink Floyd was not likely to record or perform again, saying &quot;I have had a wonderful time, but it&apos;s over. For me, it&apos;s much less complicated to work alone.&quot; Gilmour performed a critically lauded series of acoustic shows in London in 2002, and in 2006 he released a new solo album, On an Island. The album was followed with a major concert tour; Gilmour&apos;s London concert was videotaped for a 2007 DVD release, Remember That Night: Live at the Royal Albert Hall, while a show at the Gdansk shipyards with a full orchestra appeared on the 2008 album Live in Gdansk. In 2010, Gilmour teamed up with acclaimed ambient electronic act the Orb for a collaborative album, Metallic Spheres. When not busy with music, he devotes much of his time to charitable causes, and when he put his London home on the market in 2003, he donated the 3.6 million pounds realized from the sale to Crisis, a group benefiting the homeless. ~ Mark Deming" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63757/thumb/1445626715" art="/library/metadata/63757/art/1445626715" addedAt="1438447680" updatedAt="1445626715">

  <Directory ratingKey="65661" key="/library/metadata/65661/children" type="artist" title="David Gray" summary="British singer/songwriter David Gray had already released three overlooked albums by the time White Ladder (and its international breakthrough hit, &quot;Babylon&quot;) brought his mix of acoustic instruments and electronic samples to the mainstream. Born in Manchester in 1968, Gray relocated to Wales at the age of nine before returning home to attend the University of Liverpool. While in school, he dabbled in several punk bands and began exploring new styles of writing, eventually uncovering his own poetic penmanship. Following a move to London, Gray signed to Hut Records in the United Kingdom and Caroline Records in the United States, releasing the debut single &quot;Birds Without Wings&quot; in 1992. The next year saw the release of his first full-length record, A Century Ends, and Gray&apos;s trademark style of fiery vocals countered with folksy, acoustic songcraft began to find an audience, particularly in Ireland. However, despite frequent solo tours (as well as an opening slot for Shawn Colvin), Gray&apos;s edgy sophomore effort, Flesh, was met with an underwhelming response in 1994, and he was dropped from his label as a result.&#xD;&#xA;Gray signed a new contract with EMI Records; meanwhile, the buzz in Ireland continued to build thanks to No Disco, an alternative music video program that showcased Gray every chance it got. Hanging on to that thread, Sell, Sell, Sell arrived in 1996 in limited quantities. Gray hitched up his touring boots and hit the road again, this time opening for such heavy-hitters as Radiohead and Dave Matthews Band, but a lack of mainstream response resulted in Gray&apos;s split from EMI. Recapturing and embracing his independence, he decided to self-finance his fourth album, White Ladder, and release it on his own label, IHT Records, in 1998. Recorded in a London apartment with an easy blend of samplers and acoustic guitar, White Ladder was a sublime leap forward for the underappreciated Gray. Ireland certainly recognized its merit, as the record immediately climbed into the Irish Top 30. Gray found other outlets for promotion as well, offering five tunes (including the elegiac title track) to the soundtrack of This Year&apos;s Love. The good fortune continued as former road pal Dave Matthews (who had taken a liking to Gray during their shared tour) made White Ladder the first release on his own ATO Records imprint in 2000. Boosted by this additional release, &quot;Babylon&quot; enjoyed a positive reception in the U.S. and peaked at number five on the U.K. charts. Its success coincided with Gray&apos;s performance on the main stage at Glastonbury, and White Ladder went on to enjoy multi-platinum sales.&#xD;&#xA;Gray celebrated his newfound recognition by issuing a handful of albums in 2001, including a pair of compilations (Lost Songs 95-98 and The EP&apos;s 92-94) and two reissued records (A Century Ends and Flesh). Although his popularity remained greater in Europe, he maintained moderate success in the States as well, and A New Day at Midnight followed up his successful international breakthrough in the fall of 2002. Gray worked with producer Marius de Vries (BjÃ¶rk, Rufus Wainwright) for 2005&apos;s Life in Slow Motion; the reflective album debuted at the top of the charts in both Ireland and the U.K., giving Gray the highest chart rankings of his career. The singer then cobbled together his older material for 2007&apos;s Shine: The Best of the Early Years. The career-spanning Greatest Hits followed that fall, featuring two new tracks as well as Gray&apos;s most popular numbers.&#xD;&#xA;Once again, David Gray found himself without a record label as he prepared to work on his eighth studio album. After setting up shop in his own studio, dubbed the Church Studios, Gray began shaping his first set of original material since 2005. Vocalists Annie Lennox and Jolie Holland joined him on several songs, and the resulting Draw the Line was released in 2009 by Gray&apos;s new label, Polydor Records. &quot;Fugitive&quot; became a Top 40 hit in America, and the album itself charted well in multiple countries. Gray quickly returned with another album, Foundling, which drew its material from the Draw the Line sessions and hit stores less than 12 months after the previous album&apos;s release. ~ Andrew Leahey &amp; Kelly McCartney" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65661/thumb/1445628402" art="/library/metadata/65661/art/1445628402" addedAt="1438446455" updatedAt="1445628402">

  <Directory ratingKey="65648" key="/library/metadata/65648/children" type="artist" title="Death Cab For Cutie" summary="Death Cab for Cutie&apos;s rise from small-time solo project to Grammy-nominated rock band is one of indie rock&apos;s greatest success stories. Launched in the bayside college town of Bellingham, Washington, the group was originally a side project for singer/guitarist Ben Gibbard, an engineering student at Western Washington University who split his time between school and music. Taking a break from his local power pop band, Pinwheel, Gibbard began recording an album&apos;s worth of solo material during the summer of 1997. Producer Chris Walla lent his help to the sessions, which resulted in an eight-song cassette entitled You Can Play These Songs with Chords. When the tape became a local hit, Gibbard reached into his circle of friends to form a band, hoping to play the new songs live. Bassist Nick Harmer (Gibbard&apos;s roommate) and drummer Nathan Good climbed aboard, and Walla enlisted as the band&apos;s primary guitarist (he would also go on to produce most of the band&apos;s future releases). With a lineup now in place, Gibbard&apos;s group rechristened itself Death Cab for Cutie (named after a song by the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band) and signed a contract with the Seattle-based Barsuk Records within a year&apos;s time.&#xD;&#xA;The quartet made its studio debut with 1998&apos;s Something About Airplanes, an album that featured several re-recorded tracks from the You Can Play These Songs with Chords cassette as well as a dreamy, pop-oriented sound reminiscent of Built to Spill. Gibbard and Walla both continued to pursue their own projects (including Gibbard&apos;s successful stint with the Postal Service), but that didn&apos;t keep Death Cab for Cutie from returning to the studio for a second album, We Have the Facts and We&apos;re Voting Yes, which appeared in 2000. Nathan Good left the group just prior to the album&apos;s completion, and We Have the Facts introduced Michael Schorr as Death Cab&apos;s new drummer. The Forbidden Love EP arrived that same year, while a third full-length effort, The Photo Album, was released in 2001. By this time, a sizable audience had gathered around the band&apos;s emotional music, and Barsuk re-released You Can Play These Songs with Chords in 2002 with ten additional songs. &#xD;&#xA;The polished, hook-laden Transatlanticism arrived in 2003 and announced the arrival of drummer Jason McGerr, who had previously played in a band with Nick Harmer before Death Cab&apos;s formation. The album also proved to be a very important step in the band&apos;s career, gathering positive attention from consumers and industry execs (including television producer Josh Schwartz, who prominently featured the band&apos;s music throughout several seasons of The O.C.). With their popularity at an all-time high, the bandmates issued a live disc, The John Byrd E.P., and later signed a worldwide major-label deal with Atlantic Records in November 2004. &#xD;&#xA;Plans was released the following summer and debuted at number four, remaining on the Billboard charts for nearly one year and achieving platinum status on the strength of three singles (including the acoustic ballad &quot;I Will Follow You into the Dark&quot;). Death Cab for Cutie graced the cover of Spin magazine, appeared on an episode of Saturday Night Live, and earned a Grammy nomination for their major-label debut. Work on a follow-up album coincided with the release of Chris Walla&apos;s solo effort, Field Manual, and Death Cab returned in May 2008 with Narrow Stairs, a darker effort that debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. The band proceeded to tour throughout the remainder of the year, while a deluxe version of Something About Airplanes (which was packaged with a recording of their very first show in Seattle) was released in November to introduce newer fans to Death Cab&apos;s early material.&#xD;&#xA;Death Cab for Cutie continued touring throughout the first half of 2009, hitting Japan and Australia as well as an additional slew of American venues. The Open Door EP arrived that spring, featuring several scrapped songs from the Narrow Stairs sessions and a demo version of &quot;Talking Bird.&quot; The guys incorporated some of those songs into their live sets, all the while preparing to return to the studio after the tour&apos;s completion. After a short hiatus -- not to mention a wedding for Ben Gibbard, who married actress/musician Zooey Deschanel -- they reconvened for 2011&apos;s Codes and Keys, which found the band relying less on the electric guitar and more on moody, Cure-inspired song textures. Later in 2011 (right around the same time Gibbard and Deschanel announced their split) they released an EP of remixes of songs from the album titled Keys and Codes Remix EP. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65648/thumb/1445628361" art="/library/metadata/65648/art/1445628361" addedAt="1438446470" updatedAt="1445628361">

Formed in Scotland in 1982 by bassist/vocalist/songwriter Justin Currie and longtime guitarist and collaborator Ian Harvie, the duo released Sense Sickness on a small Glasgow indie label the following year. Through heavy touring and positive word of mouth, the band -- which now included drummer Paul Tyagi and guitar player Bryan Tolland -- managed to impress the suits at Chrysalis Records enough to offer the fledgling group a recording contract. Their Hugh Jones-produced self-titled major-label debut was released in 1985 amidst a tidal wave of hype, but their signature blend of new wave and country-folk isolated audiences and critics alike, resulting in their inevitable departure from the Chrysalis family. &#xD;&#xA;Del Amitri rebounded with a self-financed U.S. tour that broadened their network of fans and landed them a deal with A&amp;M. In 1987 the quartet expanded by one, adding keyboardist Andy Alston and replacing Tolland with David Cummings and Tyagi with Brian McDermott, and began work on Waking Hours. Released in 1989, the Gil Norton/Hugh Jones-produced LP yielded the band&apos;s first British hit, &quot;Kiss This Thing Goodbye,&quot; a song that also found success in the U.S. In 1992 the group charted with &quot;Always the Last to Know&quot; from the Change Everything album, but it wasn&apos;t until the release of 1995&apos;s Twisted and its infectious hit &quot;Roll to Me&quot; that Del Amitri could declare global victory. &#xD;&#xA;Their follow-up, Some Other Sucker&apos;s Parade, relied heavily on the adult alternative jangle pop that made Twisted such a success, but failed to generate any lasting hits. Hatful of Rain: The Best of Del Amitri, a much-needed career-spanning anthology that collected the prolific yet spotty group&apos;s best tunes, was released in 1998 along with a companion CD, B-Sides Lousy With Love.

After touring with a British classical ensemble, she accepted a publishing job. Meanwhile, she sang with a series of local groups before joining the trip-hop outfit Faithless -- helmed by her older brother, the noted DJ and producer Rollo -- in 1995. The group released its debut album, Reverence, the following year. It went on to sell over five million copies worldwide, and Dido parlayed her newfound success into a solo deal with Arista Records. &#xD;&#xA;Dido&apos;s ethereal solo material combined elements of acoustic pop and electronica. She released her debut LP, No Angel, in mid-1999, and supported the release by joining the Lilith Fair tour that summer. However, her biggest break arrived in 2000, when rap superstar Eminem sampled one of her tracks, &quot;Thank You,&quot; for the chorus of his hit single &quot;Stan.&quot; The result was a surprisingly touching song, and demand for the Dido original quickly escalated. &quot;Thank You&quot; became a Top Five smash in early 2001, as did the accompanying No Angel, whose album sales topped 12 million copies worldwide by the time Dido returned to the spotlight two years later. &#xD;&#xA;In September 2003, she released her long-awaited follow-up, Life for Rent. This sophomore effort was layered with personal hardship and heartbreak, marking some of Dido&apos;s more honest material yet. An eagerly anticipated record, it became one of the fastest-selling albums in U.K. history, quickly going multi-platinum at home while also moving several million copies in America. Following a world tour, Dido once again retreated from the public eye in 2005 to work on her third solo release. Safe Trip Home arrived in 2008, featuring collaborations with Brian Eno, Mick Fleetwood, and Citizen Cope. Shortly after this, she recorded the single &quot;Everything to Lose,&quot; which subsequently appeared on the Sex and the City 2 soundtrack. In 2011, she worked with producer A.R Rahman on the single &quot;If I Rise&quot; and began work on her fourth studio album, Girl Who Got Away, with producers Rollo Armstrong and Jeff Bhasker, as well as guest producer Brian Eno on the track &quot;Day Before We Went to War.&quot; Described by herself as a &quot;big, fun electronic extravaganza,&quot; the album was scheduled for release in early 2013 ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65612/thumb/1445628363" art="/library/metadata/65612/art/1445628363" addedAt="1438446497" updatedAt="1445628363">

  <Directory ratingKey="65605" key="/library/metadata/65605/children" type="artist" title="Dire Straits" summary="Dire Straits emerged during the post-punk era of the late &apos;70s, and while their sound was minimalistic and stripped down, they owed little to punk. If anything, the band was a direct outgrowth of the roots revivalism of pub rock, but where pub rock celebrated good times, Dire Straits were melancholy. Led by guitarist/vocalist Mark Knopfler, the group built their sound upon the laid-back blues-rock of J.J. Cale, but they also had jazz and country inflections, occasionally dipping into the epic song structures of progressive rock. The band&apos;s music was offset by Knopfler&apos;s lyrics, which approximated the winding, stream-of-conscious narratives of Bob Dylan. As their career progressed, Dire Straits became more refined and their new maturity happened to coincide with the rise of MTV and the compact disc. These two musical revolutions from the mid-&apos;80s helped make Dire Straits&apos; sixth album, Brothers in Arms, an international blockbuster. The band -- along with Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, and Steve Winwood -- become one of the leaders of a group of self-consciously mature veteran rock &amp; rollers in the late &apos;80s that designed their music to appeal to aging baby boomers. Despite the band&apos;s international success, they couldn&apos;t sustain their stardom, waiting a full six years to deliver a follow-up to Brothers in Arms, by which time their audience had shrunk significantly. &#xD;&#xA;Knopfler (born August 12, 1949) was always the main force behind Dire Straits. The son of an architect, Knopfler studied English literature at Leeds University and worked briefly as a rock critic for the Yorkshire Evening Post while at college. He began teaching English after his graduation, leading a pub rock band called Brewer&apos;s Droop at night. By 1977, Mark was playing with his brother David (guitar) and his roommate John Illsley (bass). During the summer of 1977, the trio cut a demo with drummer Pick Withers. A London DJ named Charlie Gillett heard the demo and began playing &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; on his BBC show Honky Tonkin&apos;. Following a tour opening for Talking Heads, the band began recording their debut for Vertigo Records with producer Muff Winwood in early 1978. By the summer, they had signed with Warner in America, releasing their eponymous debut in the fall. Thanks to the Top Ten hit &quot;Sultans of Swing,&quot; Dire Straits was a major success in both Britain and America, with the single and album climbing into the Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic.&#xD;&#xA;Dire Straits established Dire Straits as a major force on album-oriented radio in America, and their second album, Communique (1979), consolidated their audience, selling three million copies worldwide. As the group was recording its third album, Knopfler left the band to pursue a solo career; he was replaced by former Darling member Hal Lindes. Like its predecessor, Making Movies was a sizable hit in America and Britain, even though the band was criticized for musically treading water. Nevertheless, the record went gold on the strength of the radio and MTV hits &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Skateaway.&quot; Dire Straits followed the album two years later with Love Over Gold, an album filled with long, experimental passages, plus the single &quot;Private Investigations,&quot; which became a number two hit in the U.K. The album went gold in America and spent four weeks at number one in Britain. Shortly after the release of Love Over Gold, former Rockpile drummer Terry Williams replaced Withers.&#xD;&#xA;During 1982, Knopfler began exploring musical avenues outside of Dire Straits, scoring the Bill Forsyth film Local Hero and playing on Van Morrison&apos;s Beautiful Vision. Apart from releasing the Twisting by the Pool EP early in 1983, Dire Straits were quiet for the majority of 1983 and 1984, as Knopfler produced Bob Dylan&apos;s Infidels, as well as Aztec Camera and Willy DeVille; he also wrote &quot;Private Dancer for Tina Turner&apos;s comeback album. In the spring of 1984, the band released the double album Alchemy: Dire Straits Live and by the end of the year, they had begun recording their fifth studio album with their new keyboardist, Guy Fletcher. Released in the summer of 1985, Brothers in Arms was Dire Straits&apos; breakthrough album, making the band international stars. Supported by the groundbreaking computer-animated video for &quot;Money for Nothing,&quot; a song which mocked music videos, the album became a blockbuster, spending nine weeks at the top of the American charts and selling over nine million copies; in England, the album became the biggest-selling album of the &apos;80s. &quot;Walk of Life&quot; and &quot;So Far Away&quot; kept Brothers in Arms in the charts through 1986, and Dire Straits played over 200 dates in support of the album. Once the tour was completed, Dire Straits went on hiatus for several years, as Knopfler produced records by Randy Newman and Joan Armatrading, scored films, toured with Eric Clapton, and recorded a duet album with Chet Atkins (Neck and Neck, 1990). In 1989, he formed the country-rock group Notting Hillbillies, whose sole album, Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time, became a British hit upon its spring 1990 release. During the extended time off, John Illsley recorded his second album; the first appeared in 1984.&#xD;&#xA;In 1990, Knopfler reconvened Dire Straits, which now featured Illsley, Clark, Fletcher, and various session musicians. The band released On Every Street in the fall of 1991 to great anticipation. However, the album failed to meet expectations -- it only went platinum in America and it didn&apos;t crack the U.K. Top 40 -- and failed to generate a hit single. Similarly, the tour was a disappointment, with many tickets going unsold in both the U.S. and Europe. Once the tour was completed, the live album On the Night was released in the spring of 1993 and the band again went on hiatus. In 1996, Knopfler launched his solo career with Golden Heart. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65605/thumb/1445628240" art="/library/metadata/65605/art/1445628240" addedAt="1438446521" updatedAt="1445628240">

As the clowns of Brit-pop, Dodgy carved out a niche with their infectious, goofy punk-pop that alternately sounded like the early Who and the Stone Roses. While they had a number of hit singles in the UK, highlighted by &quot;Staying Out for the Summer,&quot; their quirky British humor prevented them from landing an American record deal for several years. Nevertheless, Dodgy was able to maintain a devoted cult following into the late &apos;90s, as they kept turning out catchy, silly power-pop tunes.&#xD;&#xA;An early version of Dodgy formed in the late &apos;80s, when Nigel Clarke (vocals, bass) and Mathew Priest (drums) moved from their native Birmingham to London. As they began working odd jobs, they placed an advertisement for a guitarist, eventually recruiting Andy Miller. Over the next few years, Dodgy played frequently, including regular stints at the Dodgy Club, where they made their live debut. In 1991, they formed their own Bostin record label to release their own singles, including &quot;Summer Fayre&quot; and &quot;Easy Way.&quot;. By the end of 1992, Dodgy had earned a sizable following, attracting the attention of major labels. They signed a contract with A&amp;M later that year, releasing their debut, The Dodgy Album, in May 1993. The record was praised by the British music press, and Dodgy soon became regulars at the emerging Camden pop scene, which was headed by Blur. &#xD;&#xA;Dodgy returned during the fall of 1994 with the single &quot;Staying Out for the Summer,&quot; which became their first Top 40 hit. It set the stage for their breakthrough album, Homegrown, which was greeted with positive reviews upon its October release. Following a year of touring in 1995, the band returned in the summer of 1996 with Free Peace Sweet, which was their biggest hit to date, spawning the hits &quot;In A Room,&quot; &quot;Good Enough&quot; and &quot;If You&apos;re Thinking of Me,&quot; which peaked at number 11. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/57934/thumb/1445624355" art="/library/metadata/57934/art/1445624355" addedAt="1438453499" updatedAt="1445624355">

  <Directory ratingKey="63714" key="/library/metadata/63714/children" type="artist" title="Dr. Dre" summary="More than any other rapper, Dr. Dre was responsible for moving away from the avant-noise and political stance of Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions as well as the party vibes of old-school rap. Instead, Dre pioneered gangsta rap and his own variation of the sound, G-funk. BDP&apos;s early albums were hardcore but cautionary tales of the criminal mind, but Dre&apos;s records with N.W.A. celebrated the hedonistic, amoralistic side of gang life. Dre was never much of a rapper -- his rhymes were simple and his delivery was slow and clumsy -- but as a producer, he was extraordinary. With N.W.A. he melded the noise collages of the Bomb Squad with funky rhythms. On his own, he reworked George Clinton&apos;s elastic funk into the self-styled G-funk, a slow-rolling variation that relied more on sound than content. When he left N.W.A. in 1992, he founded Death Row Records with Suge Knight, and the label quickly became the dominant force in mid-&apos;90s hip-hop thanks to his debut, The Chronic. Soon, most rap records imitated its sound, and his productions for Snoop Doggy Dogg and Blackstreet were massive hits. For nearly four years, G-funk dominated hip-hop, and Dre had enough sense to abandon it and Death Row just before the whole empire collapsed in late 1996. Dre retaliated by forming a new company, Aftermath, and while it was initially slow getting started, his bold moves forward earned critical respect.&#xD;&#xA;Dre (born Andre Young, February 18, 1965) became involved in hip-hop during the early &apos;80s, performing at house parties and clubs with the World Class Wreckin&apos; Cru around South Central Los Angeles and making a handful of recordings along the way. In 1986, he met Ice Cube, and the two rappers began writing songs for Ruthless Records, a label started by former drug pusher Eazy-E. Eazy tried to give one of the duo&apos;s songs, &quot;Boyz-n-the Hood,&quot; to HBO, a group signed to Ruthless. When the group refused, Eazy formed N.W.A. -- an acronym for Niggaz With Attitude -- with Dre and Cube, releasing their first album in 1987. A year later, N.W.A. delivered Straight Outta Compton, a vicious hardcore record that became an underground hit with virtually no support from radio, the press, or MTV. N.W.A. became notorious for their hardcore lyrics, especially those of &quot;Fuck tha Police,&quot; which resulted in the FBI sending a warning letter to Ruthless and its parent company, Priority, suggesting that the group should watch their step.&#xD;&#xA;Most of the group&apos;s political threat left with Cube when he departed in late 1989 amid many financial disagreements. While Eazy appeared to be the undisputed leader following Cube&apos;s departure -- and he was certainly responsible for the group approaching near-parodic levels with their final pair of records -- the music was in Dre&apos;s hands. On both the 1990 EP 100 Miles and Runnin&apos; and the 1991 album Efil4zaggin (&quot;Niggaz4life&quot; spelled backward), he created dense, funky sonic landscapes that were as responsible for keeping N.W.A. at the top of the charts as Eazy&apos;s comic-book lyrics. While the group was at the peak of their popularity in 1991, Dre began to make efforts to leave the crew, especially after he was charged with assaulting the host of a televised rap show in 1991. The following year, Dre left the group to form Death Row Records with Suge Knight. According to legend, Knight held N.W.A.&apos;s manager at gunpoint and threatened to kill him if he refused to let Dre out of his contract.&#xD;&#xA;Dre released his first solo single, &quot;Deep Cover,&quot; in the spring of 1992. Not only was the record the debut of his elastic G-funk sound, it also was the beginning of his collaboration with rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. Dre discovered Snoop through his stepbrother Warren G, and he immediately began working with the rapper -- Snoop was on Dre&apos;s 1992 debut, The Chronic, as much as Dre himself. Thanks to the singles &quot;Nuthin&apos; but a &apos;G&apos; Thang,&quot; &quot;Dre Day,&quot; and &quot;Let Me Ride,&quot; The Chronic was a multi-platinum, Top Ten smash, and the entire world of hip-hop changed with it. For the next four years, it was virtually impossible to hear mainstream hip-hop that wasn&apos;t effected in some way by Dre and his patented G-funk. Not only did he produce Snoop&apos;s 1993 debut, Doggystyle, but he orchestrated several soundtracks, including Above the Rim and Murder Was the Case (both 1994), which functioned as samplers for his new artists and production techniques, and he helmed hit records such as Blackstreet&apos;s &quot;No Diggity,&quot; among others, including a hit reunion with Ice Cube, &quot;Natural Born Killaz.&quot; During this entire time, Dre released no new records, but he didn&apos;t need to -- all of Death Row was under his control, and most of his peers mimicked his techniques.&#xD;&#xA;The Death Row dynasty held strong until the spring of 1996, when Dre grew frustrated with Knight&apos;s strong-arm techniques. At the time, Death Row was devoting itself to 2Pac&apos;s label debut, All Eyez on Me (which featured Dre on the breakthrough hit, &quot;California Love&quot;), and Snoop was busy recovering from his draining murder trial. Dre left the label in the summer of 1996 to form Aftermath, declaring gangsta rap dead. While he was subjected to endless taunts from his former Death Row colleagues, their sales slipped by 1997 and Knight was imprisoned on racketeering charges by the end of the year. Dre&apos;s first album for Aftermath, the various-artists collection Dr. Dre Presents...The Aftermath received considerable media attention, but the record didn&apos;t become a hit, despite the presence of his hit single, &quot;Been There Done That.&quot; Even though the album wasn&apos;t a success, the implosion of Death Row in 1997 proved that Dre&apos;s inclinations were correct at the time. Both 2001 and its companion instrumental version followed in 1999. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63714/thumb/1445626895" art="/library/metadata/63714/art/1445626895" addedAt="1438448980" updatedAt="1445626895">

  <Directory ratingKey="65552" key="/library/metadata/65552/children" type="artist" title="Dragonette" summary="Formed by singer/songwriter Martina Sorbara and her husband, bassist Dan Kurtz, Canadian electro-poppers Dragonette have drawn comparisons to the Scissor Sisters, No Doubt, and the Killers, thanks to the new wave sheen that dominated their early sound. However, as later albums like Bodyparts and the group&apos;s international hit &quot;Hello,&quot; a collaboration with producer Martin Solveig proved, the group had a confident identity of their own. Prior to the formation of Dragonette, singer and lyricist Martina Sorbara (the daughter of a member of Ontario&apos;s provincial government, Finance Minister Greg Sorbara) had maintained a moderately successful solo career as an AOR/ adult alternative solo artist in the style of Sarah McLachlan or other delicate neo-folkies; Sorbara&apos;s debut solo album, The Cure for Bad Deeds, was released in 2002. She has since disparaged her former Lilith Fair-style musical efforts with the pungent phrase &quot;tampon music&quot;; just as notoriously, her father dismissed Dragonette in a quote to the Scottish newspaper The Daily Record as a &quot;market-driven&quot; phase that was &quot;part of the raciness of current popular culture.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;Sorbara founded Dragonette in 2005 with Kurtz (formerly of the jazz and electronica-influenced Toronto-based jam band the New Deal), guitarist Simon Craig, and drummer Joel Stouffer. A self-released and self-titled demo that year attracted the attention of the U.K. office of Mercury Records, which offered the group a recording contract the following year. Moving their base of operations from Toronto to London (and losing Craig in the process, replaced by British guitarist Will Stapleton), Dragonette released their first single, &quot;I Get Around,&quot; in April 2007. Three more singles followed, &quot;Take It Like a Man,&quot; &quot;Competition,&quot; and a gender-reversal cover of Calvin Harris&apos; hit &quot;The Girls&quot; called &quot;The Boys.&quot; Dragonette&apos;s debut album, Galore, was released in late summer 2007. The same year, Sorbara sang the lead vocals on the hit Basement Jaxx single &quot;Take Me Back to Your House.&quot; Galore was released in the U.S. in 2008 via I Surrender Records. &#xD;&#xA;The band&apos;s second album, Fixin&apos; to Thrill, a more focused and polished effort that charted in Canada&apos;s Top Ten, arrived in 2009. The following year, Dragonette released the Mixin&apos; to Thrill remix album and collaborated with several dance producers on singles such as Kaskade&apos;s &quot;Fire in Your New Shoes,&quot; Don Diablo&apos;s &quot;Animale,&quot; and, most notably, Martin Solveig&apos;s &quot;Hello.&quot; The single, which appeared on Solveig&apos;s 2011 album Smash, became a world-wide hit, topping the charts in five countries, reaching the Top Ten in ten other countries, and topping Billboard&apos;s Hot Dance Club chart in the U.S. early in 2011 (the song ultimately earned the group a Juno for Dance Recording of the Year in 2012). In 2011, Dragonette co-wrote and produced the song &quot;Lucky Day&quot; for Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts&apos; solo album Cinderella&apos;s Eyes, and returned to the studio to work on their third album. Released in 2012, Bodyparts was the first Dragonette album to be produced by the band, as well as the first to be released in Canada and the U.S. at the same time. ~ Stewart Mason" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65552/thumb/1445628208" art="/library/metadata/65552/art/1445628208" addedAt="1438446608" updatedAt="1445628208">

  <Directory ratingKey="63694" key="/library/metadata/63694/children" type="artist" title="Duffy" summary="Emerging during the same boom of retro U.K.-based singers that launched Amy Winehouse, Duffy distinguished herself with a melodic, vintage voice that brought to mind such &apos;60s artists as Dusty Springfield and Petula Clark. Born in the small coastal town of Nefyn on the Llyn Peninsula in Gwynedd, Wales, Amy Ann Duffy began singing at an early age. With a record collection limited to her parents&apos; classic LPs, though, she had few influences to draw from. Her father&apos;s VHS tapes of the 1960s television rock show Ready Steady Go! thus became one of her biggest sources of inspiration, and Duffy started performing with various bands throughout her teenage years, sporting a charmingly retro sound that caught the ear of Rough Trade Records owner Jeannette Lee in 2004. Lee helped nurture the singer&apos;s talent by pairing her up with former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler. The duo co-wrote several songs, including the single &quot;Rockferry,&quot; which revealed Duffy&apos;s knack for soulful music inspired by Stax and Motown. &#xD;&#xA;&quot;Rockferry&quot; became the title song of Duffy&apos;s debut album, which was released on Polydor in 2008. However, it took a different song -- &quot;Mercy&quot; -- to make her an international star. &quot;Mercy&quot; topped the charts in the U.K., the first song by a Welsh female in a quarter-century to hit number one, and the follow-up single, &quot;Warwick Avenue,&quot; peaked at number three. Overseas, &quot;Mercy&quot; also scored platinum status in America. Rockferry became one of the year&apos;s most popular records, selling over two million copies in the U.K. alone, winning a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album, and going multi-platinum in multiple other countries. Duffy began working on her second album in 2009, taking some time off to make her acting debut in the 2010 drama Patagonia. Meanwhile, recording sessions for the album took place in England and New York, with Albert Hammond pulling a double shift as producer and co-writer. The result, Endlessly, was released in November 2010. ~ Matt Collar &amp; Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63694/thumb/1445626647" art="/library/metadata/63694/art/1445626647" addedAt="1438453539" updatedAt="1445626647">

Originally dubbed Snowfield, the group comprised four music technology students from Stafford University -- singer/guitarist Tom Smith, lead guitarist Chris Urbanowicz, bassist Russell Leetch, and drummer Ed Lay -- all of whom had relocated to Birmingham after graduation. A series of a well-received club dates and demo recordings earned Editors some attention from British labels, and the group soon signed with the revitalized Kitchenware, the venerable indie label once home to Prefab Sprout. &#xD;&#xA;Kitchenware issued the band&apos;s debut single, &quot;Bullets,&quot; in early January 2005. The record reportedly sold out in one day, and its sound earned comparisons to the dark, dramatic atmospherics of contemporary bands like Interpol and Bloc Party (not to mention veteran outfits like Joy Division and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen). Editors&apos; follow-up single, &quot;Munich,&quot; made them darlings of the U.K. music press, and just weeks after their standout performance at the annual Glastonbury Music Festival, the band issued a third single, &quot;Blood.&quot; Their much-anticipated debut LP, The Back Room, followed in mid-2005. &quot;Munich&quot; was reissued in January 2006 to ramp up support for the album, which entered the Top Five in the U.K. and eventually earned platinum sales. A U.S. tour with stellastarr* coincided with the American release of The Back Room in March, and a Mercury Music Prize nomination followed in July. &#xD;&#xA;Editors&apos; sophomore effort, An End Has a Start, came out the following summer, preceded by the Top 10 single &quot;Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors.&quot; Like its predecessor, the album went platinum in the U.K. and maintained the band&apos;s modest audience in America, where the band returned in September 2007 to launch another stateside tour. Editors remained on the road through the middle of 2008, playing a slew of festivals in the U.K. and opening a string of European shows for R.E.M. before the year was up. The musicians had grown tired of their sound, however, and 2009 found them tinkering with synthesizers and industrial music. After enlisting the help of producer Flood (known for his work with Depeche Mode, U2, and Nine Inch Nails), the band decamped to the studio to record In This Light and on This Evening, which unveiled the band&apos;s new direction upon its release in October 2009. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60305/thumb/1445625127" art="/library/metadata/60305/art/1445625127" addedAt="1438454275" updatedAt="1445625127">

One of these recordings caught the attention of indie DB, which signed the siblings in 2001. Renamed the Electric Soft Parade and enlisting the aid of bassist Matt Thwaites and keyboardist Steve Large, that April the group issued the single &quot;Silent to the Dark,&quot; which showcased their mix of latter-day Brit-pop sensibilities with doses of American-style modern rock and psychedelia. DB issued the full-length Holes in the Wall in early 2002, and extensive touring followed. There was even a bit of Oasis-style brotherly strife to spark the interest of the British music press. The Electric Soft Parade jumped to BMG for The American Adventure, which was issued in the U.K. in October 2003. Large left the band during this period, and drummer Matthew Priest was brought into the fold. The band went on the road throughout the next year, sharing the stage with bands like Elbow, Starsailor, and the Who. They then returned to the studio and recorded the Human Body EP, which arrived in 2006. The band&apos;s third full-length effort, No Need to Be Down-Hearted, came out a year later. From 2008 to 2010, the band went on hiatus from touring and recording. In 2010, they reunited to perform at the Maximalism! charity concert. The EP A Quick One appeared in 2011.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country&apos;s east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at University also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the internet, where early tracks like &quot;Starry Eyed&quot; and a cover of Sam Sparro&apos;s &quot;Black &amp; Gold&quot; were posted on taste-making MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.&#xD;&#xA;During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC&apos;s &quot;Sound of 2010,&quot; a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding&apos;s vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off a Top Five single, &quot;Starry Eyed,&quot; which also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand. Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John&apos;s &quot;Your Song,&quot; which peaked at number two). In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released, entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as supplement to the original release. ~ Andrew Leahey &amp; Jason Birchmeier" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/57911/thumb/1445624372" art="/library/metadata/57911/art/1445624372" addedAt="1438448214" updatedAt="1445624372">

Torrini was raised in KÃ³pavogur, where she worked at her father&apos;s Italian restaurant and attended opera school as a teenager. After releasing three albums in her native Iceland (Spoon, CrouÃ§ie D&apos;oÃ¹ LÃ , and Merman), she joined forces with Tears for Fears&apos; Roland Orzabal to produce her first widely released effort, 1999&apos;s Love in the Time of Science. The famed Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson heard her cool, otherworldly croon and approved Torrini to voice the finale music for 2002&apos;s The Two Towers, a job that BjÃ¶rk had previously accepted before backing out due to pregnancy. Torrini followed up this cinematic achievement by co-writing a pair of songs for Kylie Minogue (including the number one hit single &quot;Slow&quot;) and releasing the soft-spoken but beautiful Fisherman&apos;s Woman, her first album for the London-based label Rough Trade Records. Fisherman&apos;s Woman was a back-to-basics effort that deemphasized Torrini&apos;s use of electronics in favor of acoustic guitar, piano, and the singer&apos;s cherubic vocals. It also cemented her fruitful partnership with producer Dan Carey, who remained with Torrini during the recording of her next solo effort, 2008&apos;s Me and Armini. The record spawned European hit single &quot;Jungle Drum,&quot; which shot to number one in her native Iceland, as well as Germany and Belgium. Torrini took the album on a two-year worldwide tour and then became a parent in 2010, after which she took a short break from music. Both of these events changed her approach to music and influenced her songwriting process heavily.

  <Directory ratingKey="63647" key="/library/metadata/63647/children" type="artist" title="Erasure" summary="Following the disbandment of the short-lived synth pop group Yazoo, former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke formed Erasure in 1985 with singer Andy Bell. Like Yaz and Depeche Mode, Erasure were a synth-based group, but they had stronger dance inclinations, as well as a sharper, more accessible sense of pop songcraft, than either of Clarke&apos;s previous bands. Furthermore, Erasure had the flamboyantly eccentric Andy Bell -- one of the first openly gay performers in pop music -- as their focal point. Bell&apos;s keening, high voice and exaggerated sense of theatrically became the band&apos;s defining image. In their native Britain, Erasure were successful from their inception. After a few years, the duo achieved commercial success in America with 1988&apos;s &quot;Chains of Love,&quot; but they remained, in essence, a cult band on both sides of the Atlantic, cultivating a dedicated fan base over the course of their career.&#xD;&#xA;Before forming Erasure, Clarke was one of the founding members of the groundbreaking synth pop outfit Depeche Mode. He left after recording only one album with the group, choosing to form Yaz with Alison Moyet instead. After Yaz released two albums, Moyet left to pursue a solo career. Clarke participated in a short-lived alliance with vocalist Feargal Sharkey and producer Eric Radcliffe called the Assembly in 1984. Following a single with vocalist Paul Quinn, he decided to form Erasure. Clarke placed an advertisement for vocalists within a British music newspaper and received over 40 demo tapes, from which Bell was selected as his partner.&#xD;&#xA;Released in 1986, Erasure&apos;s first album, Wonderland, received poor reviews and weak sales upon its release. The duo quickly followed the album with &quot;Sometimes,&quot; a preview from their forthcoming second album. &quot;Sometimes&quot; reached number two on the U.K. charts, beginning a string of successful singles that would run into the &apos;90s. The Circus, the group&apos;s second album, was released in the spring of 1987 and peaked at number six on the U.K. charts. The Innocents, Erasure&apos;s third album, became their first number one album in Britain upon its release in 1988. The album featured the group&apos;s first American hit, &quot;Chains of Love,&quot; which reached number 12 in the U.S.; its follow-up, &quot;A Little Respect,&quot; peaked at number 14 in America. At the end of 1988, Erasure released the Crackers International EP, which reached number two in Britain.&#xD;&#xA;Erasure&apos;s fourth album, Wild!, appeared in 1989, and like its predecessor, it reached number one in the U.K., as did its successor, 1991&apos;s Chorus. Erasure released the Abba-esque EP, a tribute to the Swedish pop group ABBA, in 1992; it became their first number one single in the U.K. Later that year, Erasure released a compilation of their British singles, Pop! The First 20 Hits. Two years later, the duo released its fifth album, I Say I Say I Say, which featured the hit single &quot;Always,&quot; their first American hit since 1988. Erasure&apos;s eponymous sixth album was released in the fall of 1995. It was followed in the spring of 1997 by Cowboy. Loveboat surfaced three years later. The all-covers Other People&apos;s Songs appeared in 2003, the same year as the oddly chosen compilation Hits! Before the release of 2005&apos;s &quot;return to form&quot; album Nightbird, Bell revealed he was HIV positive and had been since June of 1998. The 2006 album Union Street found the duo unplugging and re-recording old album tracks and B-sides with acoustic instruments. A tour with a full band supported the album and was documented on the 2007 live release On the Road to Nashville. Later in the year the return-to-form album Light at the End of the World arrived. Tomorrow&apos;s World followed in 2011 with the duo handing production over to Frankmusik, who had previous worked included Lady Gaga and the Pet Shop Boys. In 2013 they released Snow Globe, a holiday album featuring new songs from the duo along with some classic Christmas carols. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63647/thumb/1445626593" art="/library/metadata/63647/art/1445626593" addedAt="1438453237" updatedAt="1445626593">

By the time they recorded their first album in 1985, the band had already had a string of lead vocalists, including Courtney Love; their debut, We Care a Lot, featured Chuck Mosley&apos;s abrasive vocals but was driven by Jim Martin&apos;s metallic guitar. Faith No More&apos;s next album, 1987&apos;s Introduce Yourself, was a more cohesive and impressive effort; for the first time, the rap and metal elements didn&apos;t sound like they were fighting each other.&#xD;&#xA;In 1988, the rest of the band fired Mosley; he was replaced by Bay Area vocalist Mike Patton during the recording of their next album, The Real Thing. Patton was a more accomplished vocalist, able to change effortlessly between rapping and singing, as well as adding a considerably more bizarre slant to the lyrics. Besides adding a new vocalist, the band had tightened its attack and the result was the genre-bending hit single &quot;Epic,&quot; which established them as a major hard rock act.&#xD;&#xA;Following up the hit wasn&apos;t as easy, however. Faith No More followed their breakthrough success with 1992&apos;s Angel Dust, one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label. Although it sold respectably, it didn&apos;t have the crossover potential of the first album. When the band toured in support of the album, tensions between the band and Martin began to escalate; rumors that his guitar was stripped from some of the final mixes of Angel Dust began to circulate. As the band was recording its fifth album in early 1994, it was confirmed that Martin had been fired from the band.&#xD;&#xA;Faith No More recorded King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime with Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. During tour preparations he was replaced by Dean Mentia. Mentia only lasted for the length of the King for a Day tour and was replaced by Jon Hudson for 1997&apos;s Album of the Year. Upon the conclusion of the album&apos;s supporting tour, Faith No More announced they were disbanding in April 1998. Patton, who had previously fronted Mr. Bungle and had avant-garde projects with John Zorn, formed a new band named FantÃ´mas with Melvins guitarist Buzz Osbourne, Mr. Bungle bassist Trevor Dunn, and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. Roddy Bottum continued with his band Imperial Teen, who released their first album, Seasick, in 1996. A posthumous Faith No More retrospective, Who Cares a Lot, appeared in late 1998. &#xD;&#xA;In 2009, after eleven years of dissolution, Faith No More toured Europe without Jim Martin but with Patton as vocalist.

  <Directory ratingKey="57868" key="/library/metadata/57868/children" type="artist" title="Fall Out Boy" summary="Fall Out Boy rose to the forefront of emo pop in the mid-2000s, selling more than four million albums thanks to the band&apos;s tabloid-grabbing bassist, able-voiced frontman, and handful of Top 40 hits. The group&apos;s four members first came together in suburban Wilmette, a bedroom community just 14 miles north of Chicago, around 2001. Vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz, drummer Andrew Hurley, and guitarist Joe Trohman had all taken part in various bands connected to Chicago&apos;s underground hardcore scene. Most notably, Hurley drummed for Racetraitor, the furiously political metalcore outfit whose brief output was both a rallying point and sticking point within the hardcore community. As Fall Out Boy, the quartet used the unbridled intensity of hardcore as a foundation for melody-drenched pop-punk, with a heavy debt to the emo scene. They debuted with a self-released demo in 2001, following it up in May 2002 with a split LP (issued on the Uprising label) that also featured Project Rocket, for which Hurley also drummed. The band remained with the label for the release of a mini-LP, Fall Out Boy&apos;s Evening Out with Your Girl, but a bidding war of sorts was already in full swing. &#xD;&#xA;Fall Out Boy eventually signed a deal with Fueled by Ramen, the Florida-based label co-owned by Less Than Jake drummer Vinnie Fiorello, but also received an advance from Island Records to record a proper debut album. The advance came with a right of first refusal for Island on Fall Out Boy&apos;s next album, but it also financed the recording of Take This to Your Grave, which occurred at Butch Vig&apos;s Smart Studios compound in Madison, Wisconsin, with producer Sean O&apos;Keefe (Lucky Boys Confusion, Motion City Soundtrack) at the helm. Take This to Your Grave appeared in May 2003, and Fall Out Boy earned positive reviews for subsequent gigs at South by Southwest and various tour appearances. Their break-out album, the ambitious From Under the Cork Tree, followed in spring 2005, quickly reaching the Top Ten of Billboard&apos;s album chart and spawning two Top Ten hits with &quot;Sugar We&apos;re Going Down&quot; and the furiously upbeat &quot;Dance, Dance.&quot; The album went double platinum and earned the musicians a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. &#xD;&#xA;Fall Out Boy&apos;s underground star status -- driven by the especially extroverted Wentz, who also gained exposure with his clothing line, his Decaydance record label (an imprint of Fueled by Ramen), and eventually a celebrity relationship with Ashlee Simpson -- had boiled over into the mainstream. They toured extensively, supporting the album with international tours, arena shows, TRL visits, late-night television gigs, and music award shows. Without taking a break, the guys then hunkered down to work on their follow-up record with From Under the Cork Tree producer Neil Avron (and, somewhat surprisingly, Babyface). Infinity on High, whose title was taken from a line in one of Van Gogh&apos;s personal letters, appeared in early February 2007, spearheaded by the hit single &quot;This Ain&apos;t a Scene, It&apos;s an Arms Race.&quot; The album continued Fall Out Boy&apos;s streak, debuting at number one on the Billboard charts and going platinum one month later. Released in early 2008, the CD/DVD package Live in Phoenix documented the band&apos;s strength as a flashy live act, while the full-length studio effort Folie Ã  Deux followed later that year. &#xD;&#xA;Recording sessions for Folie Ã  Deux were tough, prompting the band to take an open-ended hiatus soon after the album&apos;s release. Joe Trohman and Andy Hurley joined a new band, Damned Things, during the interim, while Wentz teamed up with a new vocalist, Bebe Rexha, to form Black Cards. Stump took the opportunity to launch a solo career, ditching his band&apos;s emo pop music in favor of a more electronic, R&amp;B-influenced sound. &#xD;&#xA;Stump released his debut solo album Soul Punk in 2011 and despite some positive reviews, the album didn&apos;t catch fire. Pete Wentz spent time with a new band called Black Cards, but that also didn&apos;t really go anywhere, and it wasn&apos;t long before rumors of a Fall Out Boy reunion began to swirl. In February 2013 the band confirmed that the rumors were true: they had reunited for a new album called Save Rock &amp; Roll and an accompanying tour. Save Rock &amp; Roll was released in April of 2013, preceded by the single &quot;My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up).&quot; ~ Johnny Loftus &amp; Corey Apar" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/57868/thumb/1445624332" art="/library/metadata/57868/art/1445624332" addedAt="1438451448" updatedAt="1445624332">

Originally dubbed Reel, the new group&apos;s lineup was complete with the addition of Tokyo-born bassist Taka Hirose. After signing to Echo in 1995, Feeder issued their debut EP, Two Colours, followed by the six-track Swim; a series of well-received singles -- &quot;Stereo World,&quot; &quot;Tangerine,&quot; and &quot;Cement&quot; -- expanded Feeder&apos;s fan base further, and in mid-1997 they launched their full-length debut, Polythene. The hit &quot;Day In, Day Out&quot; preceded the release of the trio&apos;s sophomore effort, 1999&apos;s Yesterday Went Too Soon. Despite not catching on in America, Feeder maintained their popularity in Europe. In 2001, after touring the world relentlessly, Feeder achieved their breakthrough hit in the U.K. with &quot;Buck Rogers.&quot; The first single from the band&apos;s third album, Echo Park, eventually hit number five on the charts. Before the year&apos;s end, the band scored another Top 20 hit with the Just a Day EP and hit the road with the Stereophonics. &#xD;&#xA;Tracks for a fourth album were already in the works when tragedy struck. Founding member Jon Lee committed suicide in his Miami home in early January 2002. He was 33. Nicholas and Hirose saw it fit to continue with Feeder, and they resumed recording with former Skunk Anansie drummer Mark Richardson behind the kit. The Gil Norton-produced Comfort in Sound was released the following October. In August 2004, Feeder issued a fan-friendly B-sides collection called Picture of Perfect Youth, and Norton was again behind the boards for the Pushing the Senses LP, which followed in 2005. A year later, with tours of Japan and Europe under their belts, Feeder released The Singles in mid-2006. The career-spanning release collected 20 tracks from the band&apos;s five previous albums and a brand-new track entitled &quot;Lost &amp; Found.&quot; Select shows in Milan, Berlin, and London opening for the Rolling Stones followed that summer. Two years later, in June 2008, Feeder&apos;s sixth studio album, the self-produced Silent Cry, was released.~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65386/thumb/1445628066" art="/library/metadata/65386/art/1445628066" addedAt="1438446776" updatedAt="1445628066">

Former students of the Brit School of Performing Arts in Croydon, the quintet initially performed as Super Fly, a resident cover band playing at La Tania Ski Resort in the French Alps. The bandmembers soon realized they wanted to create their own classic rock-inspired pop and, upon returning home, rechristened themselves the Feeling. One month after their return, the Feeling had landed a record deal.&#xD;&#xA;With the backing of Island Records, the band&apos;s polished debut, Twelve Stops and Home, was released in the U.K. in June 2006, where it charted three Top Ten U.K. singles (&quot;Sewn,&quot; &quot;Fill My Little World,&quot; &quot;Never Be Lonely&quot;) and garnered a Brit Award nomination. The album was re-released on the Cherry Tree/Interscope label the following year in America -- complete with revised cover art and a retooled track listing -- but failed to match its overseas success. Nevertheless, the band&apos;s popularity at home continued to soar, and the sophomore effort, Join with Us, topped the U.K. charts upon its release in February 2008, even if its overall sales failed to match those of the previous album. In 2011 they released their third album Together We Were Made which heavily underperformed compared to their previous records, and peaked at number 22 in the U.K. charts. Later that year a collection titled Singles: 2006-2011 was released and contained all 11 singles from their three studio albums, including hits âFill My Little Worldâ and âI Thought It Was Over.â Two years later the band returned with their fourth studio outing, 2013&apos;s Boy Cried Wolf.

After playing only a handful of shows, the band generated a healthy amount of label interest and caught the attention of local producer Phil Ek, who had previously helmed records by Built to Spill and the Shins. Ek worked with the band on its Sun Giant EP, which was issued by Sub Pop Records in spring 2008.

  <Directory ratingKey="65359" key="/library/metadata/65359/children" type="artist" title="Fleetwood Mac" summary="While most bands undergo a number of changes over the course of their careers, few groups experienced such radical stylistic changes as Fleetwood Mac. Initially conceived as a hard-edged British blues combo in the late &apos;60s, the band gradually evolved into a polished pop/rock act over the course of a decade. Throughout all of their incarnations, the only consistent members of Fleetwood Mac were drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie -- the rhythm section that provided the band with its name. Ironically, they had the least influence over the musical direction of the band. Originally, guitarists Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer provided the band with its gutsy, neo-psychedelic blues-rock sound, but as both guitarists descended into mental illness, the group began moving toward pop/rock with the songwriting of pianist Christine McVie. By the mid-&apos;70s, Fleetwood Mac had relocated to California, where they added the soft rock duo of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to their lineup. Obsessed with the meticulously arranged pop of the Beach Boys and the Beatles, Buckingham helped the band become one of the most popular groups of the late &apos;70s. Combining soft rock with the confessional introspection of singer/songwriters, Fleetwood Mac created a slick but emotional sound that helped 1977&apos;s Rumours become one of the biggest-selling albums of all time. The band retained its popularity through the early &apos;80s, when Buckingham, Nicks, and Christine McVie all began pursuing solo careers. The band reunited for one album, 1987&apos;s Tango in the Night, before splintering in the late &apos;80s. Buckingham left the group initially, but the band decided to soldier on, releasing one other album before Nicks and McVie left the band in the early &apos;90s, hastening the group&apos;s commercial decline.&#xD;&#xA;The roots of Fleetwood Mac lie in John Mayall&apos;s legendary British blues outfit, the Bluesbreakers. Bassist John McVie was one of the charter members of the Bluesbreakers, joining the group in 1963. In 1966 Peter Green replaced Eric Clapton, and a year later drummer Mick Fleetwood joined. Inspired by the success of Cream, the Yardbirds, and Jimi Hendrix, the trio decided to break away from Mayall in 1967. At their debut at the British Jazz and Blues Festival in August, Bob Brunning was playing bass in the group, since McVie was still under contract to Mayall. He joined the band a few weeks after their debut; by that time, slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer had joined the band. Fleetwood Mac soon signed with Blue Horizon, releasing their eponymous debut the following year. Fleetwood Mac was an enormous hit in the U.K., spending over a year in the Top Ten. Despite its British success, the album was virtually ignored in America. During 1968, the band added guitarist Danny Kirwan. The following year, they recorded Fleetwood Mac in Chicago with a variety of bluesmen, including Willie Dixon and Otis Spann. The set was released later that year, after the band had left Blue Horizon for a one-album deal with Immediate Records; in the U.S., they signed with Reprise/Warner Bros., and by 1970, Warner began releasing the band&apos;s British records as well.&#xD;&#xA;Fleetwood Mac released English Rose and Then Play On during 1969, which both indicated that the band was expanding its music, moving away from its blues purist roots. That year, Green&apos;s &quot;Man of the World&quot; and &quot;Oh Well&quot; were number two hits. Though his music was providing the backbone of the group, Peter Green was growing increasingly disturbed due to his large ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs. After announcing that he was planning to give all of his earnings away, Green suddenly left the band in the spring of 1970; he released two solo albums over the course of the &apos;70s, but he rarely performed after leaving Fleetwood Mac. The band replaced him with Christine Perfect, a vocalist/pianist who had earned a small but loyal following in the U.K. by singing with Spencer Davis and the Chicken Shack. She had already performed uncredited on Then Play On. Contractual difficulties prevented her from becoming a full-fledged member of Fleetwood Mac until 1971; by that time she had married John McVie.&#xD;&#xA;Christine McVie didn&apos;t appear on 1970&apos;s Kiln House, the first album the band recorded without Peter Green. For that album, Jeremy Spencer dominated the band&apos;s musical direction, but he had also been undergoing mental problems due to heavy drug use. During the band&apos;s American tour in early 1971, Spencer disappeared; it was later discovered that he left the band to join the religious cult the Children of God. Fleetwood Mac had already been trying to determine the direction of their music, but Spencer&apos;s departure sent the band into disarray. Christine McVie and Danny Kirwan began to move the band towards mainstream rock on 1971&apos;s Future Games, but new guitarist Bob Welch exerted a heavy influence on 1972&apos;s Bare Trees. Kirwan was fired after Bare Trees and was replaced by guitarists Bob Weston and Dave Walker, who appeared on 1973&apos;s Penguin. Walker left after that album, and Weston departed after making its follow-up, Mystery to Me (1973). In 1974, the group&apos;s manager, Clifford Davis, formed a bogus Fleetwood Mac and had the band tour the U.S. The real Fleetwood Mac filed and won a lawsuit against the imposters -- after losing, they began performing under the name Stretch -- but the lawsuit kept the band off the road for most of the year. In the interim, they released Heroes Are Hard to Find. Late in 1974, Fleetwood Mac moved to California, with hopes of restarting their career. Welch left the band shortly after the move to form Paris.&#xD;&#xA;Early in 1975, Fleetwood and McVie were auditioning engineers for the band&apos;s new album when they heard Buckingham-Nicks, an album recorded by the soft rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. The pair were asked to join the group and their addition revived the band&apos;s musical and commercial fortunes. Not only did Buckingham and Nicks write songs, but they brought distinctive talents the band had been lacking. Buckingham was a skilled pop craftsman, capable of arranging a commercial song while keeping it musically adventurous. Nicks had a husky voice and a sexy, hippie gypsy stage persona that gave the band a charismatic frontwoman. The new lineup of Fleetwood Mac released their eponymous debut in 1975 and it slowly became a huge hit, reaching number one in 1976 on the strength of the singles &quot;Over My Head,&quot; &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me.&quot; The album would eventually sell over five million copies in the U.S. alone.&#xD;&#xA;While Fleetwood Mac had finally attained their long-desired commercial success, the band was fraying apart behind the scenes. The McVies divorced in 1976, and Buckingham and Nicks&apos; romance ended shortly afterward. The internal tensions formed the basis for the songs on their next album, Rumours. Released in the spring of 1977, Rumours became a blockbuster success, topping the American and British charts and generating the Top Ten singles &quot;Go Your Own Way,&quot; &quot;Dreams,&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t Stop,&quot; and &quot;You Make Loving Fun.&quot; It would eventually sell over 17 million copies in the U.S. alone, making it the second biggest-selling album of all time. Fleetwood Mac supported the album with an exhaustive, lucrative tour and then retired to the studio to record their follow-up to Rumours. A wildly experimental double album conceived largely by Buckingham, 1979&apos;s Tusk didn&apos;t duplicate the enormous success of Rumours, yet it did go multi-platinum and featured the Top Ten singles &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;Tusk.&quot; In 1980, they released the double-album Live.&#xD;&#xA;Following the Tusk tour, Fleetwood, Buckingham, and Nicks all recorded solo albums. Of the solo projects, Stevie Nicks&apos; Bella Donna (1981) was the most successful, peaking at number one and featuring the hit singles &quot;Stop Draggin&apos; My Heart Around,&quot; &quot;Leather and Lace,&quot; and &quot;Edge of Seventeen.&quot; Buckingham&apos;s Law and Order (1981) was a moderate success, spawning the Top Ten &quot;Trouble.&quot; Fleetwood, for his part, made a world music album called The Visitor. Fleetwood Mac reconvened in 1982 for Mirage. More conventional and accessible than Tusk, Mirage reached number one and featured the hit singles &quot;Hold Me&quot; and &quot;Gypsy.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;After Mirage, Buckingham, Nicks, and Christine McVie all worked on solo albums. The hiatus was due to a variety of reasons. Each member had his or her own manager, Nicks was becoming the group&apos;s breakaway star, Buckingham was obsessive in the studio, and each member was suffering from various substance addictions. Nicks was able to maintain her popularity, with The Wild Heart (1983) and Rock a Little (1985) both reaching the Top 15. Christine McVie also had a Top Ten hit with &quot;Got a Hold on Me&quot; in 1984. Buckingham received the strongest reviews of all, but his 1984 album Go Insane failed to generate a hit. Fleetwood Mac reunited to record a new album in 1985. Buckingham, who had grown increasingly frustrated with the musical limitations of the band, decided to make it his last Fleetwood Mac project. When the resulting album, Tango in the Night, was finally released in 1987, it was greeted with mixed reviews but strong sales, reaching the Top Ten and generating the Top 20 hits &quot;Little Lies,&quot; &quot;Seven Wonders,&quot; and &quot;Everywhere.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;Buckingham decided to leave Fleetwood Mac after completing Tango in the Night, and the group replaced him with guitarists Billy Burnette and Rick Vito. The new lineup of the band recorded their first album, Behind the Mask, in 1990. It became the band&apos;s first album since 1975 to not go gold. Following its supporting tour, Nicks and Christine McVie announced they would continue to record with the group, but not tour. Vito left the band in 1991, and the group released the box set 25 Years -- The Chain the following year. The classic Fleetwood Mac lineup of Fleetwood, the McVies, Buckingham, and Nicks reunited to play President Bill Clinton&apos;s inauguration in early 1993, but the concert did not lead to a full-fledged reunion. Later that year, Nicks left the band and was replaced by Bekka Bramlett and Dave Mason; Christine McVie left the group shortly afterward. The new lineup of Fleetwood Mac began touring in 1994, releasing Time the following year to little attention. While the new version of Fleetwood Mac wasn&apos;t commercially successful, neither were the solo careers of Buckingham, Nicks, and McVie, prompting speculation of a full-fledged reunion in 1997. Soon these whispers proved to be true, as the classic Rumours quintet reunited for a live performance that became the 1997 album The Dance. The album performed well, debuting at number one on Billboard and generating an adult contemporary hit in the new version of &quot;Landslide.&quot; Fleetwood Mac supported The Dance with a tour that lasted throughout the year and, early in 1998, the band was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Not long afterward, Christine McVie announced she was leaving the band.&#xD;&#xA;Her departure may have slowed the speed of Fleetwood Mac&apos;s reunion, but the remaining quartet set to work writing and recording a new album. The resulting Say You Will appeared in April of 2003; it was their first studio album in eight years and the first in 16 to feature Buckingham and Nicks. Say You Will performed well -- it went gold in the U.S., U.K., and Canada, with the singles &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; and &quot;Say You Will&quot; reaching the U.S. Adult Contemporary Top 20 -- and the accompanying international tour was a success. After a few quiet years where Buckingham resumed his solo career and the group unsuccessfully courted Sheryl Crow as a replacement for Christine McVie, the quartet reconvened for a tour in 2009. Four years later, the group celebrated the 35th Anniversary of Rumours with a new deluxe box reissue accompanied by a tour. As the tour got underway in April, the band unexpectedly released a four-track Extended Play of new material exclusively through iTunes. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65359/thumb/1445628046" art="/library/metadata/65359/art/1445628046" addedAt="1438446797" updatedAt="1445628046">

Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement (musician/funnyman and funnyman/musician, respectively) started crafting their unique, two-man comedy mÃ©lange in 1998, while the two were living together as college roommates. Overcome by a dream in which a V formation of Gibson Flying Vs resembled a gaggle of Concorde airplanes, the two christened themselves Flight of the Conchords and began honing their act in local comedy and rock clubs during the late &apos;90s. By 2002, they could be found playing such high-profile gigs as the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. When they returned to the fest in 2003, they were nominated for the Perrier Award, thus making them &quot;the almost award-winning fourth most popular guitar-based digi-bongo a cappella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo in New Zealand.&quot; Between those gigs, Flight of the Conchords self-released the album Folk the World Tour, and by 2005 they had become the subject of a six-part BBC Radio 2 broadcast series -- a largely improvised affair in the vein of Spinal Tap and Tenacious D. Also in 2005, the group landed a spot on HBO&apos;s Friday night series One Night Stand. &#xD;&#xA;In 2006, Clement was featured in a series of humorous commercials for the U.S.-based Outback Steakhouse restaurant chain, and later that year, the band penned a deal with U.S. indie imprint Sub Pop. The label released the half-studio, half-live EP The Distant Future a year later. Shortly after signing to Sub Pop, the two got their breaks as actors. Clement scored a starring role in the indie romantic comedy Eagle vs. Shark, and HBO offered Bret and Jemaine their own series. Flight of the Conchords thus became a comedy show, and it premiered in June of 2007. Combining the understated humor of Ricky Gervais&apos; Extras with the musical slapstick of Tenacious D&apos;s six-episode HBO series, the show followed the duo&apos;s attempt to achieve success as a band in New York City, with silly songs worked into the plot lines. After 12 well-received episodes, it was announced that the boys would return for a second season in 2008.  That April, Sub Pop released a full-length album of songs from the first season. After another ten-episode run, a compilation of songs from season two was released in October of 2009, titled I Told You I Was Freaky. ~ J.

Managed by the Camden-based DJ duo the Queens of Noize and backed by a rotating lineup of musicians, Florence + the Machine released their debut single, &quot;Kiss with a Fist,&quot; on the Moshi Moshi label in June 2008. The critically acclaimed debut album Lungs followed in July 2009 and quickly became one of the year&apos;s most popular releases in the U.K., where Florence charted four Top 40 singles in less than 12 months. The songs gathered steam in other parts of the world, too, particularly in America, where &quot;Dog Days Are Over&quot; peaked at number 21, went platinum, and even earned its own performance on the TV show Glee. Lungs was reissued the following year in a two-disc package entitled Between Two Lungs, and included a bonus 12-track disc that featured live versions and remixes. That same year, Florence + the Machine returned to the studio with producer Paul Epworth (Bloc Party, Adele) to begin work on their second full-length outing.

Other bands burned brighter but they flamed out, breaking up after scoring a hit or two, but the Foos steadily racked up success after success, filling up stadiums around the world while staying on top of the charts all the way into the second decade of the new millennium. Once the band&apos;s lineup coalesced around the time of its third album in 1999, Foo Fighters&apos; sound also gelled into a recognizable signature built upon the heavy, melodic, loud-quiet-loud template of the Pixies and Nirvana, the modern rock anchored by a love of classic guitar rock. It was commercial without pandering, creatively restless without being alienating, a sound with wide appeal delivered by a band that was happy to tour and record the way bands did back in the &apos;70s. When Wasting Light became their first number one album in America upon its release in the spring of 2011, it was confirmation that Foo Fighters were survivors who had earned a large, devoted audience primarily through hard work.&#xD;&#xA;All of this industriousness stems from Dave Grohl, who had been playing guitar and writing songs long before he began drumming. Throughout his early teens he performed in a variety of hardcore punk bands and in the late &apos;80s he joined the Washington, D.C.-area hardcore band Scream as their drummer. During Scream&apos;s final days, Grohl began recording his own material in the basement studio of his friend Barrett Jones. Some of Grohl&apos;s songs appeared on Scream&apos;s final album, Fumble. Following the band&apos;s 1990 summer tour, Grohl joined Nirvana and moved cross-country to Seattle. &#xD;&#xA;After Nirvana recorded Nevermind, Grohl went back to the D.C. area and recorded a handful of tracks that would appear on Pocketwatch, a cassette released by Simple Machines. For most of 1992, he was busy with Nirvana, but when the band was off the road, he recorded solo material with Jones, who had also moved to Seattle. The pair kept recording throughout early 1993, when Grohl returned to Nirvana to record In Utero. Grohl had toyed with the idea of releasing another independent cassette in the summer of 1993, but the plans never reached fruition. Following Kurt Cobain&apos;s suicide in 1994, the drummer kept quiet for several months. In the fall of 1994, Grohl and Jones decamped to a professional studio and recorded the songs that comprised Foo Fighters&apos; debut album in a week. Boiling down his backlog of songs to about 15 tracks, Grohl played all of the instruments on the album. He made 100 copies of the tape, passing it out to friends and associates. In no time, Grohl&apos;s solo project became the object of a fierce record company bidding war.&#xD;&#xA;Instead of embarking on a full-fledged solo career, Grohl decided to form a band. Through his wife he met Nate Mendel, the bassist for Sunny Day Real Estate. Shortly before the pair met, Jeremy Enigk, the leader of Sunny Day Real Estate, had converted to Christianity and quit the band, effectively ending the group&apos;s career. Not only did Mendel join Grohl&apos;s band, but so did Sunny Day&apos;s drummer, William Goldsmith. Former Germs and Nirvana guitarist Pat Smear rounded out the lineup. The band, named Foo Fighters after a World War II secret force that allegedly researched UFOs, signed a contract with Capitol Records. The band&apos;s self-titled debut, consisting solely of Dave Grohl&apos;s solo recordings, was released on July 4, 1995. It became an instant success in America, as &quot;This Is a Call&quot; garnered heavy alternative and album rock airplay. By early 1996, the album was certified platinum in the U.S. &#xD;&#xA;Throughout 1996, Foo Fighters supported the album with an extensive tour, enjoying a crossover hit with &quot;Big Me&quot; that spring. Late in the year, the group began recording its second album with producer Gil Norton. During the sessions, William Goldsmith left the band due to creative tensions, leaving Grohl to drum on the majority of the album. Before the record&apos;s release, Goldsmith was replaced by Taylor Hawkins, who had previously drummed with Alanis Morissette. The Colour and the Shape, Foo Fighters&apos; second album and the first they recorded as a band, was issued in May of 1997. Smear left the group in the wake of the album&apos;s completion and was replaced by guitarist Franz Stahl, whose stay proved short-lived; 1999&apos;s There Is Nothing Left to Lose was recorded as a three-piece, with ex-No Use for a Name guitarist Chris Shiflett signing on soon after. &#xD;&#xA;One by One, the group&apos;s most polished production, appeared in late 2002, followed by 2005&apos;s In Your Honor, which narrowly missed the top of Billboard&apos;s album chart. After releasing a live album titled Skin and Bones in 2006, the band returned to Norton&apos;s studio and started constructing a dozen fractured, eclectic rock songs to be released in 2007 under the name Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Grace. Two years later, the group released its first compilation, Greatest Hits, as Grohl launched his new supergroup Them Crooked Vultures, which also featured Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and Led Zeppelin&apos;s John Paul Jones. Foo Fighters reconvened for 2011&apos;s Wasting Light, a Butch Vig production that doubled as the official return of Pat Smear, who hadn&apos;t played on any of the band&apos;s albums since 1997. Wasting Light wound up as a smash success for the Foos, debuting at number one on the Billboard charts, going gold in the U.S. and garnering the band another four Grammy Awards. In the wake of Wasting Light, several other Foo projects emerged -- a limited-edition compilation of covers called Medium Rare released for Record Store Day 2011; a documentary of the band called Back and Forth -- and the group toured the album into 2012. &#xD;&#xA;In 2012, the Foo Fighters announced they were taking a hiatus and Dave Grohl immediately returned to the confines of Queens of the Stone Age, drumming on their 2013 album ...Like Clockwork, and he also threw himself into directing a documentary about the legendary Los Angeles recording studio Sound City. The film appeared early in 2013 to positive reviews and it was accompanied by a soundtrack called Sound City: Reel to Real, which featured Grohl-directed jams with a variety of Sound City veterans, plus Paul McCartney. Not long after its release, the Foo Fighters announced their hiatus had ended and they were working on a new album.  ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65301/thumb/1445627983" art="/library/metadata/65301/art/1445627983" addedAt="1438446861" updatedAt="1445627983">

Although they usually disdain their earlier work as play-for-pay club fare not representative of their later musical vision, many of the thematic concerns of their earlier 12&quot;s and their first, heavily dance-oriented LP, Accelerator, followed them into their later work. Usually filed under ambient, that work is often much more than that, drawing from the history of experimental electronic music with a relentlessness that has helped to push the calmer elements of that genre&apos;s reputation into decidedly more difficult directions.&#xD;&#xA;The pair also grew in repute as remixers, obliterating tracks by Curve, Jon Anderson, David Sylvian and Robert Fripp, and Apollo 440, and rebuilding pieces of almost majestic complexity with the remnants. The duo&apos;s works of the mid- to late &apos;90s -- Lifeforms, ISDN, and Dead Cities -- were important stopping points on the road of rabid hybridization characteristic of post-rave European experimental electronica (ambient, jungle, trip-hop, ambient dub, etc.), and the pair&apos;s somewhat punk rock attitude (despite their success) did much to underscore the scene&apos;s underground roots. After a lengthy hiatus marked by rumors of mental illness and a cottage lifestyle, Cobain and Dougans returned in 2002 with The Isness, a record heavily influenced by &apos;60s and &apos;70s psychedelia. ~ Sean Cooper" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58659/thumb/1445624621" art="/library/metadata/58659/art/1445624621" addedAt="1438448293" updatedAt="1445624621">

  <Directory ratingKey="63627" key="/library/metadata/63627/children" type="artist" title="Genesis" summary="Genesis started life as a progressive rock band, in the manner of Yes and King Crimson, before a series of membership changes brought about a transformation in their sound, into one of the most successful pop/rock bands of the 1980s and 1990s. In addition, the group has provided a launching pad for the superstardom of members Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins, and star solo careers for members Tony Banks, Michael Rutherford, and Steve Hackett. Their roots go back to 1965 and a pair of rival groups, the Garden Wall and the Anon, formed by students at the Charterhouse School in Godalming, Surrey. They merged, with the result that 15-year-olds Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, and Michael Rutherford joined with 14-year-old Anthony Phillips, calling themselves the New Anon and recording a six-song demo featuring songs primarily written by Rutherford and Phillips.&#xD;&#xA;Charterhouse alumnus, recording artist, and producer Jonathan King heard the tape and arranged for the group to continue working in the studio, and it was also King who renamed the band Genesis. In December of 1967 they cut their debut single, &quot;The Silent Sun,&quot; a very deliberate Bee Gees-style pastiche -- it was released in February of 1968 without attracting much notice from the public, and a second single, &quot;A Winter&apos;s Tale,&quot; followed with similar neglect. They also ran through a couple of drummers during this period, Chris Stewart and John Silver. At this time, the group&apos;s music was a form of lyrical folk-based progressive pop, built on lush melodies primarily carried on acoustic guitar and piano, with lyrics that tended toward the florid and trippy -- psychedelia was in vogue, and Genesis showed an exceptional facility with poetic content as well as gorgeous melodies. Their debut album, From Genesis to Revelation -- which the group has all but disowned in the decades since -- was released in March of 1969, and passed without too much notice from the music press or the public. The members began thinking about getting on with their lives outside of music, and especially attending college. But they felt strongly enough about their work to try making it as a professional band. The re-formed in 1969 and got their first paying gig in September of that year, and spent the next several months working out new material, with new drummer John Mayhew aboard.&#xD;&#xA;Genesis soon became one of the first groups signed to the fledgling Charisma label, founded by Tony Stratton-Smith, and they recorded their second album, Trespass. That record, released in October of 1970, showed the first signs of the band that Genesis would become. The music was still folk-based, some of the songs couldn&apos;t quite carry their length, and they had some way to go in terms of vocal and instrumental finesse, but it had reach if not grasp -- most of the album was comprised of extended pieces, sung with dramatic intensity, and with complex parts for all of the instruments. &#xD;&#xA;Genesis then lost two members. Mayhew left over the unhappiness with aspects of his playing, and was replaced by Phil Collins, a former child actor turned drummer who had previously played with Flaming Youth -- he also added an occasional additional lead vocal to their sound. Much more unsettling was the departure of guitarist Anthony Phillips, who had developed crippling stage fright. For some time afterward, Genesis worked as a four-piece with the guitar parts covered by Banks&apos; keyboards. Finally, just prior to Genesis beginning work on their next album, their lineup was completed with the addition of guitarist Steve Hackett, a former member of Quiet World. The band&apos;s next album, Nursery Cryme, was recorded so close to his arrival that Hackett hardly played on it -- most of the guitar parts were written and played by Michael Rutherford, and the centerpiece of the new album, &quot;The Musical Box,&quot; used material that Phillips had composed.&#xD;&#xA;There was hardly a weak moment on the record, and the music was far more exciting -- and witty -- than most of the progressive rock of the period. The heart of the record was &quot;The Musical Box,&quot; a song telling a Victorian-era story of children, murder, and ghostly apparitions that was worthy of the classic horror film Dead of Night. And while it might not have become a pop culture phenomenon, the album and the song did find an audience among collegiate listeners. The theatrical attributes of Gabriel&apos;s singing fit in well with the group&apos;s live performances during this period as he began to make ever more extensive use of masks, makeup, and props in concert, telling the framing stories in order to set up their increasingly complicated songs. Part of the reason for the stories was practical -- it gave the others, especially Hackett, a chance to retune their instruments. When presented amid the group&apos;s very strong playing, this aspect of Gabriel&apos;s work turned Genesis&apos; performances into multimedia events. And word soon began to spread about Genesis being an act that was worth hearing and, even more so, worth seeing in concert.&#xD;&#xA;Foxtrot, issued in the fall of 1972, was the flash point in Genesis&apos; history. The writing, especially on &quot;Supper&apos;s Ready&quot; -- a conceptual piece taking up an entire side of the LP -- was as sophisticated as anything in progressive rock, and the lyrics were complex and clever, but the record was never boring, or even less than bracing. It became their first to chart in England, reaching number 12. Genesis&apos; live performances by now were practically legend. Rock music had always contained a theatrical element, which had reached new levels in the late &apos;60s. But Peter Gabriel, with his growing array of costume changes and acting out of roles, far transcended anything seen on a rock stage -- it was true rock theater, and an intense listening experience. &#xD;&#xA;In early 1973, the band allowed a group of performances to be taped for American radio, and with a live tape on hand and a gap to fill between studio albums, Stratton-Smith convinced the band to let him issue that same performance, in edited form, as the group&apos;s first concert album. Genesis Live featured songs from across three of their albums, including &quot;The Knife,&quot; &quot;The Musical Box,&quot; and &quot;Watcher of the Skies,&quot; presented in their most recent and dramatic incarnations. The group&apos;s next release, Selling England by the Pound (1973), was also their biggest seller to date, reaching number three in England and number 70 in America. They were still a cult band in the United States, but thanks to a lot more FM radio play, their music was getting heard beyond the ranks of the cultists, and finding new listeners by the thousands, especially on college campuses. &#xD;&#xA;The release in late 1974 of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway also marked the culmination of the group&apos;s early history. A concept album with a very involved story and a large cast of characters, its composition had been difficult, involving a story outlined and written (along with most of the lyrics) exclusively by Gabriel. A creative split developed between him and the others, however, and the division grew worse during the tour that followed. In May of 1975, Gabriel announced that he was leaving Genesis, at what seemed the very moment of their commercial breakthrough. The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway had been a breakthrough as well, played heavily on progressive FM stations and selling in far greater numbers than anyone expected of a double LP by this group -- it just missed the Top 40 in the United States, while in England it got to number ten.&#xD;&#xA;The group tried auditioning potential replacements, but it became clear that the remaining members all preferred that Phil Collins -- who had provided some vocals on the group&apos;s three prior albums -- take over as lead singer. Genesis returned to the studio as a quartet in October of 1975 to work on their new album, and the resulting Trick of the Tail was not a huge departure from their earlier work -- there were still musically challenging progressive songs on the album. The latter were reined in a bit, however, and there was some effort to make the album and the music as accessible as possible. And it worked, the album reaching number three in England and number 31 in America, their best chart showing up to that time.&#xD;&#xA;Their 1977 album Wind &amp; Wuthering contained a genuinely appealing pop song, &quot;Your Own Special Way,&quot; which helped to loft it to number three in the U.K. and number 26 in the United States. Soon after, Hackett announced that he, too, was leaving -- he was replaced on subsequent concert tours by Daryl Stuermer, but there was no permanent replacement in the studio; instead, Rutherford played all of the guitar parts on their subsequent recordings. In 1978, Genesis released the appropriately titled And Then There Were Three -- with sales driven by the hit single &quot;Follow You, Follow Me,&quot; the album got the group its first gold record award. By this time, the group had become a pure pop outfit, and its subsequent albums Duke (1980) and Abacab (1981) both topped the charts in England while brushing near or reaching the Top Ten in America.&#xD;&#xA;In 1983, the band regrouped for the self-titled Genesis, which furthered the group&apos;s record of British chart-toppers and American Top Ten hits, becoming their second million-selling U.S. album. Two years later, the group outdid itself with the release of its most commercially successful album to date, Invisible Touch, which -- driven by a quintet of Top Ten U.S. singles, including a number one chart placement for the title song -- went platinum several times over in America. &#xD;&#xA;It was seven years before the band released its next album, We Can&apos;t Dance, which debuted at number one in England and got to number four in America. During that time off, each of the members had done extensive solo work, and Collins had already become a superstar in his own right. We Can&apos;t Dance was Collins&apos; last album with the group, and with him they also lost Chester Thompson and Daryl Stuermer from the touring band. Calling All Stations (1997), featuring new vocalist Ray Wilson, seemed to please neither critics nor fans, and Wilson left the group at the conclusion of the accompanying tour. The group was on hiatus for most of the next decade, which saw the release of a pair of box sets, Genesis Archives, Vol. 1 and Genesis Archives, Vol. 2, covering the Gabriel and Collins eras, respectively. Banks, Rutherford, Hackett, Collins, and Gabriel regrouped for a one-off re-recording of &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; for inclusion on the compilation Turn It on Again: The Hits. &#xD;&#xA;Genesis were hardly heard from except in an archival capacity for most of the first decade of the 21st century. A 2007 reunion tour featuring Collins, Banks, and Rutherford got decidedly mixed critical reviews, and yielded a lackluster live CD/DVD set. But it coincided with a wave of upgraded, double-disc reissues of most of Genesis&apos; catalog and a quartet of box sets covering their history from Trespass forward -- including a complete issue of a legendary 1973 Rainbow Theatre performance -- which have rendered them among the most thoroughly documented groups of their generation. ~ Bruce Eder" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63627/thumb/1445626647" art="/library/metadata/63627/art/1445626647" addedAt="1438453142" updatedAt="1445626647">

  <Directory ratingKey="58646" key="/library/metadata/58646/children" type="artist" title="Goo Goo Dolls" summary="Early in their career, the Goo Goo Dolls were frequently dismissed by critics as mere imitators of the Replacements; however, they refined and mainstreamed their sound to become one of the most popular adult alternative rock bands of the 1990s, selling millions of records to audiences largely unfamiliar with their influences. That&apos;s no knock on the band, either -- the music simply improved in craft and accessibility as the years progressed, and radio happened to be receptive to a style that, one decade earlier, would have been considered collegiate power pop. Thus, the band landed two huge hits with the acoustic ballads &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Iris,&quot; followed by a string of Top Ten singles.&#xD;&#xA;The Goo Goo Dolls formed in 1985 in Buffalo, New York. Guitarist/vocalist Johnny Rzeznik, bassist Robby Takac, and drummer George Tutuska initially banded together under the name the Sex Maggots, and their new moniker was chosen from an ad in True Detective magazine at the behest of a local club owner. Originally a cover band with a taste for power pop and classic rock &amp; roll, the group soon began writing original songs. Their early sound recalled the Replacements&apos; origins as a bratty punk band: melodic, snotty, and a little bit thrashy. That sound was the reason the band attracted the interest of the heavy metal label Metal Blade, which issued their debut album in 1987 (known either as The Goo Goo Dolls or First Release). Released in 1989, the follow-up album Jed continued in a similar vein, and the band&apos;s college radio breakthrough came with 1990&apos;s Hold Me Up, a Replacements-ish power pop record.&#xD;&#xA;Released in 1993, Superstar Car Wash was the Goo Goo Dolls&apos; artistic breakthrough; though it did nothing to quell the Replacements comparisons, it was a finely crafted pop/rock record, and its lead single, &quot;We Are the Normal,&quot; was even co-written by Replacements leader Paul Westerberg himself. Still, Superstar Car Wash wasn&apos;t the commercial force the band hoped it would be, especially in light of the success of similar bands like the Gin Blossoms. That all changed with 1995&apos;s A Boy Named Goo, when an L.A. rock station put the acoustic-driven ballad &quot;Name&quot; into heavy rotation. It was eventually released as a single and climbed into the Top Five later that year; platinum sales for the album followed close behind. Unfortunately, drummer Tutuska was no longer around to enjoy the band&apos;s success; prior to the album&apos;s release, he&apos;d been sacked and replaced by Mike Malinin.&#xD;&#xA;Dissatisfied with the royalty rates in their Metal Blade contract, the Goo Goo Dolls waged a legal battle that wound up allowing them to jump to parent company Warner Bros. Somewhat drained, Rzeznik and the band shook off a case of writer&apos;s block to contribute a new ballad, &quot;Iris,&quot; to the soundtrack of the 1998 Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan romance City of Angels. Appearing that April, the song became a monster smash, although it was never released as a single (so its official Top Ten pop chart status doesn&apos;t convey how popular it was). For a better indicator, &quot;Iris&quot; spent nearly a year on Billboard&apos;s airplay charts, including an astonishing 18 weeks at number one, and was nominated for three Grammys. &#xD;&#xA;The band&apos;s next album, Dizzy Up the Girl, was released during the middle of &quot;Iris&quot;&apos;s marathon airplay run and eventually sold over three million copies. Its clean, polished sound completed the Goo Goo Dolls&apos; transformation into mainstream pop/rockers who happened to have alternative roots. Further hits from the record followed over the next year, including &quot;Slide,&quot; &quot;Dizzy,&quot; &quot;Broadway,&quot; and the Grammy-nominated &quot;Black Balloon.&quot; Although Dizzy Up the Girl quickly became the Goo Goo Dolls&apos; highest-selling album ever, none of its singles appeared on the band&apos;s 2001&apos;s career retrospective, Ego, Opinion, Art &amp; Commerce, which focused on earlier material and B-sides instead.&#xD;&#xA;The Goo Goo Dolls&apos; audience shrank a bit during the 2000s, although the band still managed to go gold with its seventh studio album, 2002&apos;s Gutterflower. A concert recording, Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004, appeared two years later and helped fans endure the long wait for the band&apos;s next studio effort, Let Love In, which didn&apos;t appear until 2006. It, too, went gold, as did three of its singles: &quot;Better Days,&quot; &quot;Stay with You,&quot; and a cover of Supertramp&apos;s &quot;Give a Little Bit.&quot; A traditional greatest-hits album, Greatest Hits, Vol. 1: The Singles, was released in 2007, followed one year later by Vol. 2, which followed Ego, Opinion, Art &amp; Commerce&apos;s lead by compiling rarities, B-sides, cover songs, and live performances into one package. &#xD;&#xA;Recording sessions for the band&apos;s ninth album began taking place in spring 2009 with producer Tim Palmer. Although a release date was scheduled for February 2010, the band headed back into the studio in January to make several last-minute changes to the album, with longtime producer Rob Cavallo -- who also worked on Dizzy Up the Girl and Gutterflower -- lending his help. Something for the Rest of Us was ultimately released that summer. The album debuted at seven on the Billboard 200 but generated no hit singles. The Goo Goo Dolls supported the album into 2011 and in 2012, they turned their attention to recording a new album. The resulting Magnetic was released in June of 2013, preceded by the single &quot;Rebel Beat.&quot; ~ Steve Huey &amp; Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58646/thumb/1445624606" art="/library/metadata/58646/art/1445624606" addedAt="1438452798" updatedAt="1445624606">

  <Directory ratingKey="60165" key="/library/metadata/60165/children" type="artist" title="Green Day" summary="Out of all the post-Nirvana alternative bands to break into the pop mainstream, Green Day were second only to Pearl Jam in terms of influence. At their core, Green Day were simply punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs. Though their music wasn&apos;t particularly innovative, they brought the sound of late-&apos;70s punk to a new, younger generation with Dookie, their 1994 major-label debut. Dookie sold over ten million copies, paving the way for a string of multi-platinum releases that opened the doors for a flood of American neo-punk, punk metal, and third wave ska revivalists. More than a decade later, as many of their former contemporaries settled into retirement, Green Day remained at the forefront of popular music with albums like the Grammy-winning American Idiot.&#xD;&#xA;Green Day arose from the Northern California underground punk scene. Childhood friends Billie Joe Armstrong (guitar, vocals) and Mike Dirnt (bass; born Mike Pritchard) formed their first band, Sweet Children, in Rodeo, California when they were 14 years old. By 1989, the group had added drummer Al Sobrante and changed its name to Green Day. That same year, the band independently released its first EP, 1000 Hours, which was well-received in the California hardcore punk scene. Soon, the group had signed a contract with the local independent label Lookout. Green Day&apos;s first full album, 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hour, was released later that year. Shortly after its release, the band replaced Sobrante with Tre Cool (born Frank Edwin Wright III), who became the band&apos;s permanent drummer.&#xD;&#xA;Throughout the early &apos;90s, Green Day continued to cultivate a cult following, which only gained strength with the release of their second album, 1992&apos;s Kerplunk. The underground success of Kerplunk led to a wave of interest from major record labels, and the band eventually decided to sign with Reprise. Dookie, Green Day&apos;s major-label debut, was released in the spring of 1994. Thanks to MTV support for the initial single, &quot;Longview,&quot; Dookie became a major hit. The album continued to gain momentum throughout the summer, with the second single, &quot;Basket Case,&quot; spending five weeks on the top of the American modern rock charts. At the end of the summer, the band stole the show at Woodstock &apos;94, which helped the sales of Dookie increase. By the time the fourth single, &quot;When I Come Around,&quot; began its seven-week stay at number one on the modern rock charts in early 1995, Dookie had sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone; it would eventually top ten million in America, selling over 15 million copies internationally. Dookie also won the 1994 Grammy for Best Alternative Music Performance.&#xD;&#xA;Green Day quickly followed Dookie with Insomniac in the fall of 1995; during the summer, they hit number one again on the modern rock charts with &quot;J.A.R.,&quot; their contribution to the Angus soundtrack. Insomniac performed well initially, entering the U.S. charts at number two and selling over two million copies by the spring of 1996, yet none of its singles -- including the radio favorite &quot;Brain Stew/Jaded&quot; -- was as popular as those from Dookie. In the spring of 1996, Green Day abruptly canceled a European tour, claiming exhaustion. Following the cancellation, the band spent the rest of the year resting and writing new material before issuing Nimrod in late 1997. Three years later, their long-awaited follow-up, a refreshingly poppy record titled Warning, was released. Another long wait preceded 2004&apos;s American Idiot, an aggressive rock opera that became a surprise success -- a chart-topper around the world, a multi-platinum Grammy winner, and easily the best reviewed album of their career. Green Day reveled in the album&apos;s success, hitting numerous award shows and performing as part of Live 8 in July 2005. That fall brought the release of Bullet in a Bible, a concert album that documented the trio&apos;s expansive Idiot live show.&#xD;&#xA;With their popularity and commercial viability restored, Green Day took on several small projects before returning to the studio. They contributed a cover of John Lennon&apos;s &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; to the charity album Instant Karma, appeared in The Simpsons Movie, and recorded an entire album of &apos;60s-styled rock &amp; roll under the alias of Foxboro Hot Tubs. While presenting an award at the Grammys in early 2009, the band announced the impending release of Green Day&apos;s eighth album, 21st Century Breakdown, which had been recorded with veteran producer Butch Vig. In May of 2009, 21st Century Breakdown was released, picking up where American Idiot left off, as another ambitious punk rock opera. The album was a commercial success, selling over 215,000 copies in its first three days of sales. In 2009, American Idiot was adapted for the stage, and the following year, Green Day lent their talents to the original cast recording, combining a driving score with Broadway vocal arrangements. The band released the live Awesome as F**k in 2011. &#xD;&#xA;During the summer of 2012, Green Day unveiled their ambitious plans for the fall and winter: they would release not one but three new albums. The records -- Â¡Uno!, Â¡Dos!, Â¡TrÃ©! -- would appear in September 2012, November 2012, and January 2013, respectively, with each individual bandmember gracing one of the album covers on his own. The first, appropriately called Â¡Uno!, was preceded by the disco-rock single &quot;Kill the DJ&quot; and the anthemic arena rocker &quot;Oh Love.&quot; Â¡Uno! was set for a splashy release in September 2012, but the weekend prior to its release Billie Joe Armstrong had an onstage breakdown during a set Green Day played at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas. Days later, it was announced that Armstrong entered rehab for undisclosed substance abuse; not long afterward the band&apos;s touring plans for 2013 were canceled. Â¡Dos! arrived as scheduled in November 2012 and Â¡TrÃ©! was moved up to a December release. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60165/thumb/1445625107" art="/library/metadata/60165/art/1445625107" addedAt="1438446903" updatedAt="1445625107">

New Yorkers Hooper and Zucconi, through sheer kismet, forged a friendship with the latter three members while attending an art residency in Greece on the island of Crete. Before returning to their myriad homelands, the future quintet members began hashing out plans to meet up again and put some of the music they had been working on to tape, resulting in whirlwind trips to Rabin&apos;s Los Angeles studio, where the five friends decided to make their relationship official. Grouplove&apos;s eponymous debut EP was released by Canvasback in 2010. While touring alongside Florence + the Machine early the following year, Grouplove managed to finalize plans for their debut full-length album, Never Trust a Happy Song, which appeared later that fall.

The punk-inspired indie rock quintet formed in 2002; they feature a brash mix of Dexy&apos;s Midnight Runners melodies, Franz Ferdinand hooks, and the theatrics of the Dead 60s. Hard-Fi self-released Stars of CCTV in October 2004, and all 500 copies quickly sold out. The U.K. indie imprint Necessary reissued the nine-song nugget the following June. Once again, HARD-Fi got the attention of the fickle British press and an eager British public. Singles such as &quot;Cash Machine,&quot; &quot;Tied Up Too Tight,&quot; and &quot;Hard to Beat&quot; were all chart hits, and U.K. show dates with the likes of the Bravery, the Kaiser Chiefs, and the Ordinary Boys were equally successful. Before the year&apos;s end, Hard-Fi earned a Mercury Music Prize nomination for Stars of CCTV. They had also won over audiences at Glastonbury and at the annual SXSW Festival in Austin, TX. Two Brit Award nominations followed in early 2006 -- one for Best British Group and another for Best British Rock Act. Stars of CCTV went on to earn a number one spot on the U.K. album chart in January 2006; it was released in the U.S. in March, and although it didn&apos;t make quite as big of a splash stateside, it still set up high expectations for Hard-Fi&apos;s next record, Once Upon a Time in the West, which came out in September of 2007. The following year, the band announced they were beginning work on a new album, and began a lengthy recording process that included working with producers like The Bird and the Bee&apos;s Greg Kurstin.

  <Directory ratingKey="57855" key="/library/metadata/57855/children" type="artist" title="Imogen Heap" summary="As a rule, group efforts are normally launched before a solo career -- not after a solo career is in full swing. First, the artist makes a name for himself/herself as part of a group, then the artist leaves the group to become a full-time solo performer. That&apos;s the standard procedure, but British singer/songwriter Imogen Heap took a different approach, having already established her solo credentials for several years before becoming half of the London-based duo Frou Frou. Although based in London, Heap was raised in Essex, England, where she first studied European classical piano. While attending boarding school years later, a teenaged Heap discovered alternative pop/rock, Euro-pop, and electronica, a musical mixture that effectively ended her previous desire to become a classical instrumentalist. With her focus now devoted to popular music, she signed with Almo Sounds in 1997, becoming a professional solo artist while still in her late teens. &#xD;&#xA;I Megaphone, Imogen Heap&apos;s debut album, was released by Almo in 1998, featuring influences that ranged from Kate Bush (to whom she was frequently compared) to Annie Lennox to BjÃ¶rk. Although some tracks were self-produced, I Megaphone also found Heap working with three different producers -- David Kahne, Dave Stewart (of Eurythmics&apos; fame), and Guy Sigsworth -- the latter of whom kept in touch with Heap after the album&apos;s release. In the early 2000s, Sigsworth and Heap worked together once again, this time sharing equal responsibilities in the collaborative project Frou Frou. Despite the duo&apos;s lighthearted name, Frou Frou utilized electronics to create an atmospheric, dreamy, and nuanced sound. MCA/Universal signed the group in 2001, thus putting Heap&apos;s solo career on temporary hiatus.&#xD;&#xA;Frou Frou released Details in 2002, with &quot;Breath In&quot; serving as the album&apos;s first single. Two years later, a wider audience discovered Frou Frou&apos;s music when &quot;Let Go&quot; was included in the award-winning Garden State soundtrack. Frou Frou had already disbanded by this point, however, and Heap had begun returning her focus to her solo career. She released Speak for Yourself in 2005, gaining notice for such singles as &quot;Hide &amp; Seek&quot; (an a cappella song that utilized a digital harmonizer) and &quot;Goodnight and Go.&quot; Ellipse, her third studio album, which she recorded in locations including Japan, Thailand, China, and her home studio, appeared in 2009. ~ Alex Henderson" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/57855/thumb/1445624307" art="/library/metadata/57855/art/1445624307" addedAt="1438447624" updatedAt="1445624307">

  <Directory ratingKey="65209" key="/library/metadata/65209/children" type="artist" title="James Morrison" summary="At the ripe old age of 21, James Morrison became an overnight sensation in the U.K. with the release of his debut album, 2006&apos;s Undiscovered, which wasted little time going platinum in the British Isles. Blessed with a fresh, soulful voice that alternated between smooth and rough tones (and suggested a British Stevie Wonder), Morrison recalled both the passion of classic soul music and the confessional lyrical stance of the singer/songwriters of the 1970s. Morrison was born in the West Midlands town of Rugby, where he soaked up the influence of his parents&apos; record collection. His mother was a fan of soul, especially artists like Otis Redding, Van Morrison, and Al Green, while his dad was big on country and classic folk musicians such as Leadbelly and Woody Guthrie. During interviews conducted years later, Morrison alluded to an unhappy childhood touched by poverty and illness -- describing his hometown, he told one a journalist that &quot;the best thing is I&apos;ve got memories of being a kid there and the worst thing is I&apos;ve got memories of being a kid there&quot; -- and early on he struck out on his own, earning pocket money by busking on the streets of Porth, a village near the Cornish coast. &#xD;&#xA;Morrison worked odd jobs across the country while writing songs and playing gigs whenever he could, and his big break came when a demo of his material caught the ear of an A&amp;R man at Polydor Records. Morrison was quickly signed to the label, and he went into the studio with producer Martin Terefe to record the 13 original songs that comprise Undiscovered, which was released in August 2006. A well-received appearance on Jools Holland&apos;s chat show Later and an opening slot on Corinne Bailey Rae&apos;s British concert tour made Morrison an artist to watch, and his songs &quot;You Give Me Something&quot; and &quot;Wonderful World&quot; became major hits in the U.K. In January 2007, Morrison played a short tour of the United States as the buzz about his album began to cross the ocean. Songs for You, Truths for Me appeared the following year and helped maintain the singer&apos;s popularity in the U.K., where the album charted at number three. Nelly Furtado contributed vocals to the song &quot;Broken Strings,&quot; which became Morrison&apos;s most successful single to date. The Awakening, Morrison&apos;s third studio outing, arrived in September 2011. ~ Mark Deming" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65209/thumb/1445627836" art="/library/metadata/65209/art/1445627836" addedAt="1438446923" updatedAt="1445627836">

However, it was Mraz&apos;s interest and participation in musical theater that served as his first introduction to music. Following high school, he moved to New York to attend the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, but dropped out a year later when he took up the guitar and began to focus on songwriting. Nonetheless, Mraz&apos;s training as a vocalist would later show itself on his debut album, which was marked by the pure clarity and range of his tenor range.&#xD;&#xA;After busking around New York, Mraz eventually returned to Virginia; in 1999, however, he made his way out West and settled in San Diego, California, having been drawn to the city&apos;s coffeehouse scene and historical support of singer/songwriters, most notably Jewel. Mraz began playing shows and soon landed a weekly residency at the local hot spot Java Joe&apos;s, which had previously played host to Jewel during the early stages of her career. He also formed a duo with drummer Noel &quot;Toca&quot; Rivera, who accompanied Mraz&apos;s acoustic material by banging the djembe. Together, the musicians honed a live show that featured as much comedic banter as actual music. &#xD;&#xA;Over the next two years, Mraz&apos;s following expanded outside of the San Diego limits and began to encompass Los Angeles, garnering the attention of record labels. Mraz signed to Elektra Records in early 2002 and returned to Virginia to write and record his debut album, a project that saw him working with producer John AlagÃ­a (the Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer) and his high school heroes, the Agents of Good Roots, who became his backing band. The resulting effort, Waiting for My Rocket to Come, was released that same November, blending Mraz&apos;s early influences with elements of country, roots rock, and coffeehouse folk. The buoyant first single &quot;Remedy [I Won&apos;t Worry],&quot; which Mraz had co-written with pop hitmakers the Matrix, proved to be a big hit, and Mraz headed out on the road to support it. One of those shows, an October 2003 date at the Eagles Ballroom in Milwaukee, was later documented on Mraz&apos;s summer 2004 live release Tonight, Not Again. The album tided his fans over until July 2005, when the songwriter returned with the sophomore studio effort Mr. A-Z. Mraz&apos;s popularity reached a new high in 2008 with the release of We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things, which peaked at number three and spawned his first chart-topping single, &quot;I&apos;m Yours.&quot; The concert album, Jason Mraz&apos;s Beautiful Mess: Live on Earth, arrived in 2009, followed by his fourth studio album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, in 2012. ~ Christina Saraceno" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65115/thumb/1445627771" art="/library/metadata/65115/art/1445627771" addedAt="1438446943" updatedAt="1445627771">

  <Directory ratingKey="65098" key="/library/metadata/65098/children" type="artist" title="Jimmy Eat World" summary="Once a trailblazing name in the mid-&apos;90s emocore scene, Jimmy Eat World eventually found a larger audience by embracing a blend of alternative rock and power pop that targeted the heart as well as the head. The band&apos;s influence widened considerably with 1999&apos;s Clarity -- an album that has since emerged as a landmark of the emo genre -- it was the band&apos;s follow-up (specifically the infectious single &quot;The Middle&quot;) that crowned them as major figures in commercial rock. The emo label proved difficult to shake throughout the 2000s, even when subsequent albums like Futures and Chase This Light did little to evoke the hard-edged sensitivity of Clarity, but Jimmy Eat World still remained a league above the generation of emocore torch-bearers they helped spawn. &#xD;&#xA;Jimmy Eat World formed in February 1994 in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, Arizona. Jim Adkins (vocals/guitar) and Zach Lind (drums) met while attending Mountain View High School; years of playing in local bands had also introduced them to locals Tom Linton (guitar/vocals) and Mitch Porter (bass). The four musicians joined forces and derived the band&apos;s moniker from an argument between Linton&apos;s younger brothers, Ed and Jimmy. The two siblings were prone to fighting, with the heavyset Jimmy usually emerging as the victor. One day, a revengeful Ed resorted to drawing a picture of his heavyset older brother shoving the entire world into his mouth. The caption &quot;Jimmy Eat World&quot; was printed beneath, and the band deemed it a perfect fit. Citing influences like Rocket from the Crypt, early Def Leppard, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Fugazi, and the Velvet Underground, Jimmy Eat World outfitted themselves as a punk rock act and began playing small shows in the Phoenix valley. &#xD;&#xA;Over the course of 1994 and early 1995, Jimmy Eat World released several EPs and singles on Wooden Blue Records, an imprint based in the nearby town of Tempe. Limited-edition pressings of &quot;One, Two, Three, Four,&quot; &quot;Back from the Dead Mother Fucker,&quot; and split EPs with Christie Front Drive, Emery, and Blueprint would later run out of print, as would the band&apos;s self-titled debut album. The band&apos;s audience was steadily growing, and Capitol Records responded by signing Jimmy Eat World in mid-1995, when bandleaders Adkins and Linton were only 19 years old. Porter soon exited the group; Linton&apos;s best mate since seventh grade, bassist Rick Burch, was enlisted as a replacement, and the band marked their major debut with the release of 1996&apos;s Static Prevails.&#xD;&#xA;Three years passed; by 1999, Jimmy Eat World had officially transformed themselves into an emo outfit with the release of their intricate sophomore album, Clarity. The record marked Adkins&apos; first time as the group&apos;s lead singer and principal songwriter, two roles that Linton had previously handled. Unfortunately, Capitol Records had also experienced some significant changes, ultimately culminating in the departure of president Gary Gersh -- the same man who signed Jimmy Eat World in 1995. Capitol&apos;s new management balked at Clarity&apos;s sensitive sound and started to shelve the album; it wasn&apos;t until several key radio stations (including L.A.&apos;s influential KROQ) started airing the song &quot;Lucky Denver Mint&quot; that the label relented and released Clarity in February 1999. &quot;Lucky Denver Mint&quot; proved to be popular on the radio and in the movies, where it scored a spot in the Drew Barrymore comedy Never Been Kissed. Jimmy Eat World&apos;s fan base continued to grow, but their relationship with Capitol progressively soured. After the label shelved the band&apos;s third LP, Jimmy Eat World decided to leave the label, and Capitol was happy to let them go. &#xD;&#xA;Meanwhile, Jimmy Eat World&apos;s music was attracting an audience overseas, where Clarity had become a hit in countries like Germany. The band responded by financing and promoting a tour throughout the European continent. Singles, a collection of unreleased B-sides and rarities, was released that same year on the independent label Big Wheel Recreation. A split EP with Australian rockers Jebediah was also released, and the band scraped together the profits from those ventures before entering the studio to record Bleed American (whose title would later be changed to Jimmy Eat World after the events of September 11, 2001). Enlisting the help of Clarity&apos;s producer, Mark Trombino, the band independently created the record that would effectively launch their high-profile careers. Jimmy Eat World then used the completed product to land a contract with Dreamworks, who released the album in July 2001. While the hard-hitting title track did moderately well, it was the record&apos;s second single, &quot;The Middle,&quot; that landed Jimmy Eat World a spot on the pop/rock map. Featuring a video filled with scantily clad teenagers, the song also enjoyed heavy exposure on MTV, where a younger audience latched onto the band&apos;s summery appeal. A year after its release, Jimmy Eat World was still a fixture on the Billboard charts and modern rock radio. A third single, &quot;Sweetness,&quot; was released in summer 2002, and &quot;A Praise Chorus&quot; followed soon after, allowing the album to go platinum. &#xD;&#xA;The Dreamworks label closed its doors in January 2004, and Jimmy Eat World shifted their operations over to Interscope for the release of their fifth album. Futures was released in October 2004 and debuted at number six on the Billboard charts, eventually going gold on the strength of the Top 40 hit &quot;Pain.&quot; The Stay on My Side Tonight EP appeared one year later, featuring a Heatmiser cover and several tracks that had been axed from the Futures track list. Jimmy Eat World continued to tour in support of the album before entering the recording studio with Butch Vig, a veteran musician who had produced Nirvana&apos;s Nevermind and the Smashing Pumpkins&apos; Siamese Dream before forming a platinum-selling group of his own, Garbage. With Vig behind the controls, Jimmy Eat World recorded their sixth studio LP, Chase This Light. The leadoff single, &quot;Big Casino,&quot; was released in August 2007, and the album followed in October. The following year, the band announced that they were returning to the studio to work on a new album with their old producer, Mark Trombino. Two years later, Invented became their seventh release. In 2013, Jimmy Eat World released their eighth studio album, the Alain Johannes-produced Damage. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65098/thumb/1445627733" art="/library/metadata/65098/art/1445627733" addedAt="1438446981" updatedAt="1445627733">

In February 2003, Woods left the group for other personal goals. A permanent replacement was not known at the time of the bassist&apos;s departure. Three years later, JJ72 officially called it quits in June 2006 after more than a decade together.

Like Gershwin, Jackson possesses a restless musical imagination that has found him straddling musical genres unapologetically, disinclined to pick one style and stick to it. The word &quot;chameleon&quot; often crops up in descriptions of him, but Jackson prefers to be thought of as &quot;eclectic.&quot; Is he the Joe Jackson he appeared to be upon his popular emergence in 1979, a new wave singer/songwriter with a belligerent attitude derisively asking, &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot; The reggae-influenced Joe Jackson of 1980&apos;s Beat Crazy? The jump blues revivalist of 1981&apos;s Joe Jackson&apos;s Jumpin&apos; Jive? The New York salsa-styled singer of 1982&apos;s &quot;Steppin&apos; Out&quot;? The R&amp;B/jazz-inflected Jackson of 1984&apos;s Body &amp; Soul? Or is he David Ian Jackson, L.R.A.M. (Licentiate of the Royal Academy of Music), who composes and conducts instrumental albums of contemporary classical music such as 1987&apos;s Will Power and 1999&apos;s Grammy-winning Symphony No. 1? He is all of these, Jackson himself no doubt would reply, and a few others besides. &#xD;&#xA;The roots of that eclecticism lie in the conflicts of his youth. He was born David Ian Jackson on August 11, 1954 (not 1955, as some references mistakenly state) in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England. His parents had met when his father was in the Navy and his mother was working in her family&apos;s pub in Portsmouth on the south coast of England. They initially settled in his father&apos;s hometown, Swadlincote, on the border of Staffordshire and Derbyshire, but when Jackson was a year old, they moved back to his mother&apos;s hometown, and he was raised in Portsmouth and nearby Gosport. His father, Ronald Jackson, became a plasterer. &#xD;&#xA;Growing up in working-class poverty, Jackson was a sickly child, afflicted with asthma, first diagnosed when he was three and producing attacks that lasted into his twenties. Prevented from playing sports, he turned to books and eventually music. At 11, he began taking violin lessons, later studying timpani and oboe at school. His parents got him a secondhand piano when he was in his early teens, and he began taking lessons, soon deciding that he wanted to be a composer when he grew up. He played percussion in a citywide student orchestra. But his social milieu was more accepting of different forms of popular music than it was of the classics, and he developed a taste for that, too. Becoming interested in jazz, he formed a trio and, at the age of 16, began playing piano in a pub, his first professional gig. &#xD;&#xA;By the early &apos;70s, Jackson, who had paid little attention to rock before, became a fan of progressive rock, notably such British groups as Soft Machine. Meanwhile, in 1972, he passed an advanced &quot;S&quot; level exam in music that entitled him to a grant to study music, and he was accepted at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Rather than moving to the city, he spent his grant money on equipment and commuted several days a week to attend classes while continuing to live at home and play pop music locally. He switched from writing classical compositions to pop songs. Invited to join an established band called the Misty Set, he sang his first lead vocal on-stage. He moved to another established band called Edward Bear (the name taken from a character in Winnie the Pooh, not to be confused with the Canadian band of the same name that recorded for Capitol Records in the early &apos;70s). Deciding that he resembled the title character on a television puppet show called Joe 90, his bandmates began calling him &quot;Joe,&quot; and it stuck. After six months, the two principals in Edward Bear decided to retire from music, and with their permission he took over the name and the group&apos;s bookings and brought in a couple of his friends, lead singer/guitarist Mark Andrews (later of Mark Andrews &amp; the Gents) and bassist Graham Maby. &#xD;&#xA;Jackson continued to attend the Royal Academy, where he studied composition, orchestration, and piano while majoring in percussion. He also occasionally played piano in the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. He graduated from the academy after three years in 1975. By then, Edward Bear (forced to change its name to Edwin Bear because of the more successful Canadian band, and then to Arms &amp; Legs) were attracting more attention and acquired management, which in turn signed the band to MAM Records. In April 1976, MAM released the first Arms &amp; Legs single, with Andrews&apos; &quot;Janie&quot; on the A-side and Jackson&apos;s &quot;She&apos;ll Surprise You&quot; on the B-side. Second and third singles followed in August and February 1977, but the records did not sell. Meanwhile, in October 1976, Jackson quit the band to become pianist and musical director at the Playboy Club in Portsmouth. He was determined to save enough money to record his own album and release it himself. In August 1977, he played his first gigs as the leader of the Joe Jackson Band, singing and playing keyboards, backed by Andrews (sitting in temporarily and soon replaced by Gary Sanford), Maby, and drummer Dave Houghton. At the same time, he quit the Playboy Club job to become pianist/musical director for a cabaret act, Koffee &apos;n&apos; Kream, that was beginning a national tour in the wake of their triumph on the TV amateur show Opportunity Knocks. &#xD;&#xA;Jackson toured with Koffee &apos;n&apos; Kream from the fall of 1977 to the spring of 1978, and the money he made enabled him to move to London in January 1978 and continue recording his album in a Portsmouth studio. He began shopping demo tapes to record labels in London without success until he was heard by American producer David Kershenbaum. Kershenbaum was scouting for talent on behalf of A&amp;M Records, and he arranged for Jackson to be signed to A&amp;M on August 9, 1978, after which they immediately re-recorded Jackson&apos;s album. They completed it quickly, and at the end of the month the Joe Jackson Band embarked on an extensive national tour. &#xD;&#xA;Despite his classical education and background playing many types of pop music in pubs and clubs, Jackson had become genuinely enamored of the punk/new wave movement of the late &apos;70s in England, especially attracted by the energy and simplicity of the music and the angry, aggressive tone of the lyrics. He had no trouble incorporating these elements into his own music, and if he was, to an extent, using the new wave label as a flag of convenience, the style nevertheless was a valid vehicle of expression for him. Of course, first impressions can be lasting, and to many people he would, ever after, be an angry new wave singer/songwriter, no matter what else he did. &#xD;&#xA;In October 1978, A&amp;M released the first Joe Jackson single, &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?,&quot; a rhythmic ballad in which the singer ponders why &quot;pretty women&quot; are attracted to &quot;gorillas&quot; and worries about his own inadequacy. The record failed to chart, but Jackson and his band continued to tour around the U.K. and began to attract press attention. Look Sharp!, his debut album, followed in January 1979, again, to no significant sales at first. The LP contained more songs in the vein of &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?,&quot; many of them uptempo rockers with strong melodies and lyrics full of romantic disappointment and social criticism, bitterly expressed and with more than a touch of self-deprecation. (One, &quot;Got the Time,&quot; was sufficiently raucous to be covered by heavy metal band Anthrax in essentially the same arrangement on their Persistence of Time album in 1990.) A&amp;M released &quot;Sunday Papers,&quot; an attack on the salaciousness of tabloid newspapers, as a single in February, again without reaction. But in March, Look Sharp! finally broke into the charts, eventually peaking at the bottom of the Top 40. The same month, A&amp;M released the album in the U.S., and it quickly charted, reaching the Top 20 after &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot; was released as a single in May (while Jackson toured North America) and became a Top 40 hit; in September, the LP was certified gold in the U.S. In the U.K., &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot; was re-released in July and charted in August, making the Top 20. Jackson was nominated for a 1979 Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male, for the single. &#xD;&#xA;Meanwhile, Jackson toured more or less continually, playing dates in Continental Europe in June and then back in the U.K. through August before returning to North America. But he had found the time and inspiration to craft a quick follow-up to Look Sharp!, and his second LP, I&apos;m the Man, was released on October 5. That was a little too soon for the U.S. market, where Look Sharp! had not yet exhausted its run, and while the album made the Top 40, it was a relative sales disappointment, with the single &quot;It&apos;s Different for Girls&quot; failing to enter the Hot 100. The story was different in the U.K., however, where I&apos;m the Man made the Top 20 and &quot;It&apos;s Different for Girls&quot; reached the Top Five. Critically, the album was considered a continuation of Look Sharp!, an opinion shared by Jackson himself. The first blush of his emergence fading, Jackson was beginning to be viewed by critics as the third in a line of angry British singer/songwriters starting with Graham Parker and continuing with Elvis Costello, and his commercial success created resentment, especially because he was not as forthcoming with the media as the garrulous Costello. &#xD;&#xA;The U.S. tour ran into November, followed by more shows in the U.K. in November and December. Jackson went back on the road in February 1980 with a few U.S. dates, followed by some U.K. shows and a European tour that ran from March to May. Like other punk/new wave acts, he had used reggae rhythms on occasion, notably on &quot;Fools in Love&quot; on Look Sharp! and &quot;Geraldine and John&quot; on I&apos;m the Man. In May, he released an EP in the U.K. including a cover of Jimmy Cliff&apos;s &quot;The Harder They Come.&quot; In acknowledgment of his group&apos;s importance to his sound, the disc was billed to the Joe Jackson Band. After dates in the U.K. in May and June, the Joe Jackson Band returned to North America for a tour that lasted into August; they finally took a break after a few more shows at the end of the month. &#xD;&#xA;Beat Crazy, released in October, also was billed to the Joe Jackson Band. The album featured less of the frantic punk sound of its predecessors, instead absorbing the dub-reggae and ska influences that were topping the British charts just then in the music of bands like the Specials and the English Beat. But it was a relative disappointment commercially, peaking in the 40s in both the U.S. and U.K., with its singles failing to chart. One reason for the reduced sales in America may have been that the group did not tour to support it there. The Joe Jackson Band played a monthlong tour from October to November in the U.K., followed by a month in Europe from November to December, after which it split up, according to Jackson because Houghton no longer wanted to tour. Sanford became a session musician, while Maby stuck with Jackson. &#xD;&#xA;Jackson, in ill health following more than two years of continual touring, retreated to his family home, where he became increasingly immersed in the jump blues of 1940s star Louis Jordan. He organized a new band in the style of Jordan&apos;s Tympany 5 featuring three horn players (Pete Thomas on alto saxophone, Raul Oliveria on trumpet, and David Bitelli on tenor saxophone and clarinet) along with pianist Nick Weldon and drummer Larry Tolfree, plus Maby and Jackson himself, who played vibes and sang. The group, dubbed Joe Jackson&apos;s Jumpin&apos; Jive, played a collection of swing and jump blues standards such as &quot;Jumpin&apos; with Symphony Sid,&quot; &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain&apos;t My Baby,&quot; and &quot;Tuxedo Junction.&quot; The resulting Joe Jackson&apos;s Jumpin&apos; Jive LP, released in June 1981, was a hit in Britain, where it reached the Top 20. In the U.S., the album was not so much 35 years behind the times as 15 years ahead of them; had it appeared in the mid-&apos;90s, it would have fit right in with releases by the Brian Setzer Orchestra and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy as part of the neo-swing movement. As it was, America circa 1981 was baffled, but Jackson&apos;s core audience was sufficiently curious to push the album into the Top 50 while he toured the country with the band in July in between British dates in June and from August to September. &#xD;&#xA;Jackson went through more personal changes over the next year. He and his wife divorced, and he moved to New York City, where, true to form, he began to immerse himself in new musical genres, particularly attracted to salsa and the classic songwriting styles of Gershwin and Cole Porter. The result was Night and Day, released in June 1982, Jackson&apos;s first album to put his keyboard playing at the center of his music, with percussionist Sue Hadjopoulas also given prominence. Jackson seemed to have abandoned new wave rock for a catchy pop-jazz-salsa-dance hybrid, and he backed the release with a yearlong world tour as A&amp;M put considerable promotional muscle behind the LP. &quot;Steppin&apos; Out&quot; became a multi-format hit, earning airplay on album-oriented rock (AOR) radio before spreading to the pop and adult contemporary charts, placing in the Top Ten all around and eventually earning Grammy nominations for Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male. With that stimulus, the album reached the Top Ten and went gold, spawning a second Top 20 single in &quot;Breaking Us in Two.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;Jackson finished the Night and Day tour in May 1983. He had been asked to contribute a song to Mike&apos;s Murder, a film written and directed by James Bridges (The China Syndrome, Urban Cowboy) and starring Debra Winger (Urban Cowboy, An Officer and a Gentleman). He ended up writing both a handful of songs and a few instrumental pieces that were released on a soundtrack album in September. Unfortunately, the film itself was not ready for release then, since it was the subject of a dispute between Bridges and the movie studio that had financed it, the result being reshooting and re-editing, such that the film did not open until March 1984, by which time it had a score by John Barry and only a little of Jackson&apos;s music remaining, and then it earned only one million dollars during a few weeks of theatrical showings, making it a disastrous flop. The orphaned soundtrack album, however, managed to get into the Top 100 and even spawned a chart single in the Jackson composition &quot;Memphis,&quot; while &quot;Breakdown&quot; earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. &#xD;&#xA;Jackson returned to the studio and emerged in March 1984 with Body &amp; Soul, an album with a cover photograph showing him clutching a saxophone in the style of the 1950s LP covers of Blue Note Records. The disc inside was a follow-up to Night and Day in style, however, with a bit more of an R&amp;B tilt, and it was another commercial success, if a more modest one, reaching the Top 20 and spawning a Top 20 single in &quot;You Can&apos;t Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want).&quot; After the four-month Body &amp; Soul world tour concluded in July 1984, Jackson retreated. The tour had been, he later wrote, &quot;the hardest I ever did; it came too soon after the last one, and by the end of it I was so burned out I swore I&apos;d never tour again.&quot; He re-emerged after 18 months in January 1986 for a series of live recording sessions at the Roundabout Theatre in New York conducted for his next album. Audiences were invited to attend, but instructed to hold their applause as the performances were cut direct to a two-track tape recorder. The resulting album, Big World, released in March, had a one-hour running time, making it an ideal length for the new CD format, though it had to be pressed on two LPs with the second side of the second LP left blank. Press reaction to these two aspects of the album tended to overshadow consideration of the material, which ranged from politically charged rockers like &quot;Right or Wrong,&quot; a direct challenge to the Reagan administration, to heartfelt ballads like &quot;Home Town,&quot; a reflection on memory and loss. Jackson undertook another extensive tour lasting from May to December (one he reported enjoying much more than the last one), and the album spent six months in the charts, but only peaked in the Top 40. &#xD;&#xA;In the winter of 1985, Jackson had been commissioned to write a 20-minute score for a Japanese film, Shijin No Ie (House of the Poet), and the orchestral piece was recorded with the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra. He adapted it into &quot;Symphony in One Movement&quot; and added a few other instrumental pieces to create his next album, Will Power, his first disc to reflect his classical background. A&amp;M gave the LP a surprising promotional push that included releasing the title track as a single, and Jackson fans were sufficiently intrigued to push the album into the lower reaches of the pop chart upon its release in April 1987. But his increasing desire to include classical elements in his popular work and to issue outright &quot;serious&quot; compositions tended to put him in a no man&apos;s land where reviewers were concerned, since rock critics were for the most part incapable of judging such works and preferred that he stick to rock-based music, while classical critics simply ignored him. Had they been paying attention, however, they might not have approved of what they heard, anyway. An unrepentant Beethoven fan, Jackson had disliked his exposure to serial music and other contemporary trends in classical music when he encountered them in college; his serious compositions tended to reflect his taste for conventional concert music of the romantic and classical periods. &#xD;&#xA;While staying off the road, Jackson had two albums in release in 1988. In May, he issued the double-disc set Live 1980/86, chronicling his tours over the years. It reached the Top 100. In August came his swing-styled soundtrack to the Francis Ford Coppola film Tucker: The Man and His Dream, an effort that probably would have attracted more attention if the film had been more successful (it grossed less than $20 million). Nevertheless, the album earned a Grammy nomination for Best Album of Original Instrumental Background Score Written for a Motion Picture or TV. His next LP, released in April 1989, was Blaze of Glory, another modest seller with a peak only in the Top 100 despite radio play for the single &quot;Nineteen Forever.&quot; Jackson, who felt the album was one of his best efforts and toured to support it with an 11-piece band in the U.S. and Europe from June to November, was disappointed with both the commercial reaction and his record company&apos;s lack of support. He parted ways with A&amp;M, which promptly released the 1990 compilation Steppin&apos; Out: The Very Best of Joe Jackson, a Top Ten hit in the U.K. &#xD;&#xA;Jackson wrote his third movie score for 1991&apos;s Queens Logic; no soundtrack album was issued. Signing to Virgin Records, he released his next album, Laughter &amp; Lust, in April 1991. Here, he expressed some of his frustration with the record business in the appropriately catchy, &apos;60s-styled &quot;Hit Single,&quot; while the socially conscious &quot;Obvious Song&quot; and a percussion-filled cover of Fleetwood Mac&apos;s &quot;Oh Well&quot; attracted radio attention. But the album continued his gradual sales decline, failing to reach the Top 100 in the U.S. Another world tour stretched from May to September, after which Jackson was not heard from on record for three years. In the interim, he wrote music for two movies, the interactive film I&apos;m Your Man (1992) and the feature Three of Hearts (1993), neither of which produced soundtrack albums featuring his music. He reappeared in record stores in October 1994 with Night Music, a low-key album that attempted to fuse his pop and classical styles, including instrumentals and guest vocals by MÃ¡ire Brennan of Clannad. The album, which did not chart, was supported with a world tour that ran from November to May 1995. After it, Jackson left Virgin and signed to Sony Classical, a label more accepting of his musical ambitions. In September 1997, it released Heaven &amp; Hell, a song cycle depicting the seven deadly sins, billed to Joe Jackson &amp; Friends; the friends included such guest vocalists as folk-pop singers Jane Siberry and Suzanne Vega and opera singer Dawn Upshaw. The album reached number three in Billboard&apos;s Classical Crossover chart. A tour ran from November to April 1998. &#xD;&#xA;Jackson worked on two projects in the late &apos;90s, both of which appeared in October 1999. Sony Classical issued his Symphony No. 1, which was played not by an orchestra, but by a band of jazz and rock musicians including guitarist Steve Vai and trumpeter Terence Blanchard, and it won the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. And publishers PublicAffairs came out with Jackson&apos;s book, A Cure for Gravity: A Musical Pilgrimage, in which he wrote about his love of all kinds of music and recounted his life from his birth up to the point of his emergence as a public figure in the late &apos;70s. Bringing his story up to date, he wrote, &quot;So I&apos;m still making music, no longer a pop star -- if I ever really was -- but just a composer, which is what I wanted to be in the first place.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;Having released only semi-classical works on his last three recordings, Jackson was thought to have abandoned pop/rock music completely, but that proved not to be true. The early years of the 21st century found him in a flurry of activity, much of it returning him to the pop music realm. In June 2000, Sony Classical, through Jackson&apos;s imprint, Manticore, issued Summer in the City: Live in New York, an album drawn from an August 1999 concert that featured him playing piano and singing, backed only by Maby and drummer Gary Burke, performing some of his old songs along with covers of tunes by the Lovin&apos; Spoonful, Duke Ellington, and the Beatles, among others. Four months later came Night and Day II, a new set of songs in the spirit of his most popular recording. Touring to promote the album in Europe and North America from November to April 2001, Jackson recorded the concert CD Two Rainy Nights: Live in the Northwest (The Official Bootleg), released in January 2002 on his own Great Big Island label through his website, www.joejackson.com. (The album was reissued to retail by Koch in 2004.) &#xD;&#xA;Later in 2002, Jackson surprised longtime fans by reuniting with the original members of the Joe Jackson Band, Graham Maby, Gary Sanford, and Dave Houghton, to record a new studio album, Volume 4 (the first three volumes having been Look Sharp!, I&apos;m the Man, and Beat Crazy), released by Restless/Rykodisc in March 2003, and to embark on a world tour running through September 2003 that resulted in the live album Afterlife, issued in March 2004. As he made television appearances to promote the latter, he insisted that the reunion had been a one-time thing. Meanwhile, his recording of &quot;Steppin&apos; Out&quot; was being used in a television commercial for Lincoln Mercury automobiles, and he was preparing to score his next film, The Greatest Game Ever Played, for a 2005 release. Jackson released a new studio album, Rain, in 2008, followed by 2011&apos;s Live Music: Europe 2010, which was recorded live in Europe during his 2010 Joe Jackson Trio tour with Dave Houghton and Graham Maby. ~ William Ruhlmann" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/62296/thumb/1445626097" art="/library/metadata/62296/art/1445626097" addedAt="1438448490" updatedAt="1445626097">

  <Directory ratingKey="62236" key="/library/metadata/62236/children" type="artist" title="John Mayer" summary="After making his introduction as a sensitive, acoustic-styled songwriter on 2001&apos;s Room for Squares, John Mayer steadily widened his approach over the subsequent years, encompassing everything from blues-rock to adult contemporary in the process. Arriving during the tail end of teen pop&apos;s heyday, he crafted pop music for a more discerning audience, spiking his songcraft with jazz chords and literate turns of phrase. The combination proved to be quite popular, as Room for Squares went triple platinum before its follow-up release, Heavier Things, arrived in September 2003. Mayer continued to retool his sound with each album, however, moving beyond the material that had launched his career and adopting elements of rock, blues, and soul. Moreover, he partnered with legends of several genres, making guest appearances on albums by Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, and B.B. King, while touring alongside jazz icon Herbie Hancock. Mayer also retained enough pop/rock foundation to continue his reign of the charts, making him one of the decade&apos;s most popular songwriters.&#xD;&#xA;Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in the nearby town of Fairfield, Mayer began playing blues as a teenager. By 1997, his skill on the electric guitar was enough to warrant admission into the Berklee College of Music, although Mayer dropped out after two semesters to pursue a songwriting career in Atlanta. Working alongside former classmate Clay Cook, he frequented the local coffeehouse circuit and began co-writing material that melded palatable pop/rock with unexpected flourishes. Cook and Mayer parted ways shortly thereafter, however, with Cook joining the Marshall Tucker Band&apos;s touring lineup for several years. Now a solo artist by default, Mayer recorded several of the duo&apos;s songs, packaged them alongside a handful of his own compositions, and self-released the EP in 1999 under the title Inside Wants Out.&#xD;&#xA;Mayer secured a deal with Aware Records in early 2000, and recording sessions for his debut album commenced later that year with producer John Alagia, renowned for his work with Dave Matthews and Ben Folds Five. Although Inside Wants Out had been a decidedly acoustic effort, Room for Squares proved to be a more expansive affair, with several of Mayer&apos;s old songs receiving new, radio-ready arrangements. Released in 2001 by both Aware and Columbia Records, the album quickly launched Mayer&apos;s career, with &quot;No Such Thing&quot; and &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot; both becoming Top 20 hits. &#xD;&#xA;As Mayer hit the road in support of the album, his considerable talent as a lead guitarist (a skill that had been downplayed during Room for Squares) flourished, leading him to showcase several blues-influenced solos on his 2003 live album, Any Given Thursday. That same year, Mayer won his first Grammy Award for &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland.&quot; He returned to the Grammy ceremony two years later, this time to accept a pair of awards for &quot;Daughters,&quot; a soulful ballad from his lucrative sophomore release, Heavier Things. Commercial and critical success notwithstanding, Mayer&apos;s interest in other genres convinced him to take a brief break from pop music, and he tested his instrumental chops by collaborating with blues artists (Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Eric Clapton) and jazz legends (John Scofield, Herbie Hancock). He also assembled the John Mayer Trio, whose bluesy rock &amp; roll was displayed on the band&apos;s first and only release, Try! &#xD;&#xA;Mayer returned to his solo career with 2006&apos;s Continuum, a warmly received album that saw him focusing on blues, pop, and contemporary soul. &quot;Gravity&quot; found modest success as a single, but &quot;Waiting on the World to Change&quot; proved to be the album&apos;s commercial highlight, cracking the Top 20 in February 2007 and winning a Grammy that same month. Later that year, Mayer achieved his highest-charting single to date with &quot;Say,&quot; a song from the Rob Reiner film The Bucket List. After &quot;Say&quot; peaked at number 12, the song was included in a reissued version of Continuum, and it took home yet another Grammy Award (along with &quot;Gravity&quot;) in early 2009. &#xD;&#xA;Mayer returned to the studio in 2009 and emerged with Battle Studies, featuring the single &quot;Heartbreak Warfare.&quot; Building upon Continuum&apos;s slick, adult contemporary sound, the album sold well. However, its release marked a tough period for Mayer&apos;s public image, as he was criticized for comments he made about ex-girlfriends Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Aniston during interviews for Rolling Stone and Playboy. Subsequently, Mayer deleted his Twitter account and took some time off from appearing in public and doing interviews. &#xD;&#xA;In 2011, while recording his fifth studio album, the Don Was-produced Born and Raised, Mayer revealed that he would be receiving treatment for granulomas found near his vocal cords. Following his surgery, Mayer completed the album and debuted the leadoff single &quot;Shadow Days.&quot; A stripped-down affair, Born and Raised showcased a more rootsy, folk and country-tinged sound than his previous efforts. Three months before the album&apos;s release, a recurrence of Mayer&apos;s granulomas forced him to cancel his subsequent planned tour and abstain from singing indefinitely while he received more treatment. Upon its release, Born and Raised became Mayer&apos;s first album to spend more than two weeks at the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2013, Mayer returned to the studio with Don Was to record Paradise Valley, his sixth album and one that would continue to explore the rootsy, folk style of Born and Raised. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/62236/thumb/1445626077" art="/library/metadata/62236/art/1445626077" addedAt="1438454979" updatedAt="1445626077">

  <Directory ratingKey="62212" key="/library/metadata/62212/children" type="artist" title="John Williams" summary="The most popular film composer of the modern era, John Williams created music for some of the most successful motion pictures in Hollywood history -- Star Wars, E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, and Jurassic Park are just three of the credits in his extensive oeuvre. Born February 8, 1932, in Long Island, NY, he was himself the son of a movie studio musician, and he followed in his father&apos;s footsteps by studying music at UCLA and Juilliard; initially, he pursued a career as a jazz pianist, later working with Henry Mancini to compose the score for the hit television series Peter Gunn. Williams then went solo to pen a number of TV soundtracks for series including Playhouse 90, Wagon Train, and Bachelor Father; in 1959 he ventured into film with Daddy-O, and spent the majority of the 1960s alternating between the silver screen (The Killers, The Plainsman) and its smaller counterpart (Gilligan&apos;s Island, Lost in Space). &#xD;&#xA;In 1968 Williams earned his first Academy Award nomination for his work in Valley of the Dolls; in 1970, he garnered nods for both The Reivers and Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and two years later finally won for Fiddler on the Roof. A slew of Oscar nominations followed, for features including The Poseidon Adventure, Images, Tom Sawyer, and The Towering Inferno. In 1974 he first teamed with a young filmmaker named Steven Spielberg on a movie titled The Sugarland Express; the two frequently reteamed over the years to come, with often stunning results -- Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Jurassic Park, and Schindler&apos;s List were just a few of the Spielberg/Williams pairings, with Jaws, E.T., and Schindler&apos;s List all winning the composer Academy Awards.&#xD;&#xA;Williams&apos; other most frequent collaborator was George Lucas; beginning with 1977&apos;s Star Wars -- yet another Williams Oscar winner -- they later teamed for 1980&apos;s The Empire Strikes Back and 1983&apos;s Return of the Jedi, with the composer agreeing to score Lucas&apos; subsequent Star Wars films as they went into production in 1997. He even celebrated his 30th anniversary of working with Steven Spielberg with 2002&apos;s Minority Report soundtrack. Other scores of note included 1979&apos;s Superman, 1987&apos;s The Witches of Eastwick, 1988&apos;s The Accidental Tourist, 1991&apos;s JFK, and 1995&apos;s Nixon. In 1980, Williams also took over for the late Arthur Fiedler as the conductor of the Boston Pops. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/62212/thumb/1445626048" art="/library/metadata/62212/art/1445626048" addedAt="1438447970" updatedAt="1445626048">

Uncompromising and iconoclastic, Mitchell confounded expectations at every turn; restlessly innovative, her music evolved from deeply personal folk stylings into pop, jazz, avant-garde, and even world music, presaging the multicultural experimentation of the 1980s and 1990s by over a decade. Fiercely independent, her work steadfastly resisted the whims of both mainstream audiences and the male-dominated recording industry. While Mitchell&apos;s records never sold in the same numbers enjoyed by contemporaries like Carole King, Janis Joplin, or Aretha Franklin, none experimented so recklessly with their artistic identities or so bravely explored territory outside of the accepted confines of pop music, resulting in a creative legacy which paved the way for performers ranging from Patti Smith and Chrissie Hynde to Madonna and Courtney Love.&#xD;&#xA;Born Roberta Joan Anderson in Fort McLeod, Alberta, Canada, on November 7, 1943, she was stricken with polio at the age of nine; while recovering in a children&apos;s hospital, she began her performing career by singing to the other patients. After later teaching herself to play guitar with the aid of a Pete Seeger instruction book, she went off to art college, and became a fixture on the folk music scene around Alberta. After relocating to Toronto, she married folksinger Chuck Mitchell in 1965, and began performing under the name Joni Mitchell. &#xD;&#xA;A year later the couple moved to Detroit, MI, but separated soon after; Joni remained in the Motor City, however, and won significant press acclaim for her burgeoning songwriting skills and smoky, distinctive vocals, leading to a string of high-profile performances in New York City. There she became a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre among the media and other performers; after she signed to Reprise in 1967, David Crosby offered to produce her debut record, a self-titled acoustic effort that appeared the following year. Her songs also found great success with other singers: in 1968, Judy Collins scored a major hit with the Mitchell-penned &quot;Both Sides Now,&quot; while Fairport Convention covered &quot;Eastern Rain&quot; and Tom Rush recorded &quot;The Circle Game.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks to all of the outside exposure, Mitchell began to earn a strong cult following; her 1969 sophomore effort, Clouds, reached the Top 40, while 1970&apos;s Ladies of the Canyon sold even better on the strength of the single &quot;Big Yellow Taxi.&quot; It also included her anthemic composition &quot;Woodstock,&quot; a major hit for Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. Still, the commercial and critical approval awarded her landmark 1971 record Blue was unprecedented: a luminous, starkly confessional set written primarily during a European vacation, the album firmly established Mitchell as one of pop music&apos;s most remarkable and insightful talents.&#xD;&#xA;Predictably, she turned away from Blue&apos;s incandescent folk with 1972&apos;s For the Roses, the first of the many major stylistic turns she would take over the course of her daring career. Backed by rock-jazz performer Tom Scott, Mitchell&apos;s music began moving into more pop-oriented territory, a change typified by the single &quot;You Turn Me On (I&apos;m a Radio),&quot; her first significant hit. The follow-up, 1974&apos;s classic Court and Spark, was her most commercially successful outing: a sparkling, jazz-accented set, it reached the number two spot on the U.S. album charts and launched three hit singles -- &quot;Help Me,&quot; &quot;Free Man in Paris,&quot; and &quot;Raised on Robbery.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;After the 1974 live collection Miles of Aisles, Mitchell emerged in 1975 with The Hissing of Summer Lawns, a bold, almost avant-garde record that housed her increasingly complex songs in experimental, jazz-inspired settings; &quot;The Jungle Line&quot; introduced the rhythms of African Burundi drums, placing her far ahead of the pop world&apos;s mid-&apos;80s fascination with world music. 1976&apos;s Hejira, recorded with Weather Report bassist Jaco Pastorius, smoothed out the music&apos;s more difficult edges while employing minimalist techniques; Mitchell later performed the album&apos;s first single, &quot;Coyote,&quot; at the Band&apos;s Last Waltz concert that Thanksgiving.&#xD;&#xA;Her next effort, 1977&apos;s two-record set Don Juan&apos;s Reckless Daughter, was another ambitious move, a collection of long, largely improvisational pieces recorded with jazz players Larry Carlton and Wayne Shorter, Chaka Khan, and a battery of Latin percussionists. Shortly after the record&apos;s release, Mitchell was contacted by the legendary jazz bassist Charles Mingus, who invited her to work with him on a musical interpretation of T.S. Eliot&apos;s Four Quartets. Mingus, who was suffering from Lou Gehrig&apos;s disease, sketched out a series of melodies to which Mitchell added lyrics; however, Mingus died on January 5, 1979, before the record was completed. After Mitchell finished their collaboration on her own, she recorded the songs under the title Mingus, which was released the summer after the jazz titan&apos;s passing.&#xD;&#xA;Following her second live collection, 1980&apos;s Shadows and Light, Mitchell returned to pop territory for 1982&apos;s Wild Things Run Fast; the first single, a cover of the Elvis Presley hit &quot;(You&apos;re So Square) Baby I Don&apos;t Care,&quot; became her first chart single in eight years. Shortly after the album&apos;s release, she married bassist/sound engineer Larry Klein, who became a frequent collaborator on much of her subsequent material, including 1985&apos;s synth-driven Dog Eat Dog, co-produced by Thomas Dolby. Mitchell&apos;s move into electronics continued with 1988&apos;s Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm, featuring guests Peter Gabriel, Willie Nelson, Tom Petty, and Billy Idol.&#xD;&#xA;Mitchell returned to her roots with 1991&apos;s Night Ride Home, a spare, stripped-down collection spotlighting little more than her voice and acoustic guitar. Prior to recording 1994&apos;s Turbulent Indigo, she and Klein separated, although he still co-produced the record, which was her most acclaimed work in years. In 1996, she compiled a pair of anthologies, Hits and Misses, which collected her chart successes as well as underappreciated favorites. A new studio album, Taming the Tiger, followed in 1998. Both Sides Now, a collection of standards, followed in early 2000.&#xD;&#xA;Two years later, Mitchell resurfaced with the double-disc release Travelogue. She announced in October 2002 that this would be her last album ever, for she&apos;d grown tired of the industry. She told W magazine that she intended to retire. She also claimed she would never sign another corporate label deal and in Rolling Stone blasted the recording industry for being &quot;a cesspool.&quot; By the time Travelogue appeared a month later, Mitchell had simmered down and her plans to call it quits had been axed. Numerous compilations and remasters appeared between 2002 and 2006, culminating in the release of the independent Shine in 2007. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/62174/thumb/1445626065" art="/library/metadata/62174/art/1445626065" addedAt="1438448211" updatedAt="1445626065">

Simian" summary="Justice, a Parisian dance production duo comprised of Gaspard AugÃ© and Xavier de Rosnay, generated an international buzz with &quot;D.A.N.C.E.,&quot; a catchy single whose video and MP3 spread like wildfire across the Internet in summer 2007. Before &quot;D.A.N.C.E.&quot; became an online sensation, Justice had released a couple singles (&quot;Never Be Alone,&quot; &quot;Waters of Nazareth&quot;) on Ed Banger Records, a Parisian dance label whose roster also includes DJ Mehdi, Mr. Flash, and Uffie. &quot;Never Be Alone&quot; (aka &quot;We Are Your Friends&quot;) is particularly notable; based upon vocal samples from &quot;Never Be Alone&quot; by the British band Simian, the song was licensed in 2004 by International Deejay Gigolo Records, a German techno label helmed by DJ Hell, and consequently became popular in England and Germany, in addition to France. AugÃ© and de Rosnay were prolific remixers as well, with high-profile credits including N.E.R.D.&apos;s &quot;She Wants to Move&quot; (2004), Britney Spears&apos; &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; (2005), Death from Above 1979&apos;s &quot;Blood on Our Hands&quot; (2005), Fatboy Slim&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Let the Man&quot; (2005), Daft Punk&apos;s &quot;Human After All&quot; (2005), Soulwax&apos;s &quot;NY Excuse&quot; (2005), Franz Ferdinand&apos;s &quot;The Fallen&quot; (2006), and Mr. Oizo&apos;s &quot;Nazis&quot; (2006). &#xD;&#xA;The sensational popularity of &quot;D.A.N.C.E.&quot; in summer 2007 was driven initially by trend-setting Internet bloggers, who were quick to champion the song, in particular its video, which featured animated T-shirts. Vice Records helped fan the flames, posting numerous MP3 remixes -- for free download on its blog. All of the Internet activity set the stage perfectly for Justice&apos;s debut full-length, â  (aka Cross), which was released first in France by Because Music, then in the U.S. by Vice Records shortly thereafter. The live album A Cross the Universe landed in 2008 and helped tide fans over until Audio, Video, Disco arrived in 2011. This official sophomore release was filled with prog rock sounds, guitars, and plenty of new wave-era influences. 2013&apos;s Access All Arenas acted as another live stopgap as fans eagerly awaited the duo&apos;s next outing. ~ Jason Birchmeier" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65094/thumb/1445627731" art="/library/metadata/65094/art/1445627731" addedAt="1438447006" updatedAt="1445627731">

The Welsh duo added Paul Roberts and Russ Morgan, and began recording with 1990s Wildlife EP. Late the following year, K-Klass&apos; single &quot;Rhythm Is a Mystery&quot; reached the Top Five and they began their continual residence in the club charts with later singles &quot;Don&apos;t Stop,&quot; &quot;Let Me Show You,&quot; and &quot;What You&apos;re Missing,&quot; from their debut album, 1993&apos;s Universal.&#xD;&#xA;By the mid-&apos;90s, K-Klass had begun to move away from the original blueprint of British house and towards a more mainstream, song-oriented approach -- though one which embraced trance, nu-disco and even ambient-house. K-Klass remixes of Whitney Houston, Blondie, Frankie Knuckles, M People, Lulu, Bizarre Inc., and Bobby Brown became sizeable dancefloor hits. The 1996 K-Klass LP, Remix and Additional Production, displayed their allegiance to post-production, perhaps to the detriment of their own recording career. ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64992/thumb/1445627648" addedAt="1438447004" updatedAt="1445627648">

However, her musical talents didn&apos;t stop there: she also played the guitar, and though she learned Beatles and Fleetwood Mac songbooks, she found herself drawn to the styles of Preston Reed and Michael Hedges. Moving from Atlanta to New York to attend college, King got her first taste of solo guitar performance thanks to campus open-mike nights, and upon graduation in 2001 she decided to pursue the instrument more seriously. She started playing in subways, a venue that helped her develop her percussive technique, and when passengers would ask her if she had CDs, she realized that she could possibly make a living as a musician. &#xD;&#xA;A copy of her 2002 demo got her a short gig at the Tap Bar in the Knitting Factory, where she was seen by Velour Records head Jeff Krasno, who released her debut, Everybody Loves You, the following year. King moved to Epic imprint Red Ink for her second album, 2004&apos;s Legs to Make Us Longer, but she returned to Velour for 2006&apos;s Until We Felt Red, which, in addition to including other instrumentation (which was also found on Legs to Make Us Longer), had King&apos;s singing prominently featured. After a busy 2007 -- not only was the guitarist recording her fourth full-length, she also appeared on albums from Tegan and Sara and the Foo Fighters and contributed to the soundtracks for Into the Wild and August Rush -- King released Dreaming of Revenge in March of 2008. After a world tour, King stayed active. Her album Junior was released on Cooking Vinyl/Rounder in 2010. She also co-produced a song for Miley Cyrus with Timbaland. In the fall of 2012, King issued Glow, a collection of instrumentals on which she was backed by a string quartet, bagpipes, organic percussion, and individually designed soundscapes for each track. ~ Marisa Brown" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65024/thumb/1445627725" art="/library/metadata/65024/art/1445627725" addedAt="1438447021" updatedAt="1445627725">

  <Directory ratingKey="62001" key="/library/metadata/62001/children" type="artist" title="Kelly Clarkson" summary="The winner of Fox TV&apos;s first American Idol competition during the summer of 2002, Kelly Clarkson went from an anonymous talent to a nationally known singer in a matter of months, performing for an audience of millions. One of the show&apos;s most naturally gifted singers, the affable Texan then went on to enjoy a successful pop career, with only Carrie Underwood rivaling her as American Idol&apos;&apos;s most commercial export. &#xD;&#xA;Clarkson was born in Fort Worth and raised in Burleson, Texas, and her vocal talents were discovered in seventh grade, when a music teacher heard her voice and urged Clarkson to join the school choir. After high school, she opted to skip college and went to Hollywood to make her name; she appeared as an extra on an episode of Sabrina, The Teenage Witch, but no other opportunities materialized. Upon returning to Burleson, Clarkson worked at a movie theater, promoted Red Bull energy drinks, and ultimately worked as a cocktail waitress at a comedy club before entering the American Idol contest. &#xD;&#xA;One of 10,000 aspiring singers, Clarkson distinguished herself not only with her big, surprisingly mature voice, but also with her down-to-earth charm and sense of humor; at one of her auditions, she switched places with judge Randy Jackson, who did an impromptu version of R. Kelly&apos;s &quot;I Believe I Can Fly.&quot; Over the course of the 13-week show, her consistently strong performances of songs like &quot;Respect,&quot; &quot;Natural Woman,&quot; &quot;Stuff Like That There,&quot; and &quot;Without You&quot; earned Clarkson enough audience votes to claim one of the contest&apos;s two finalist positions. After singing &quot;A Moment Like This&quot; and &quot;Before Your Love,&quot; both of which were written for the show, Clarkson won the American Idol contest with 58-percent of the audience&apos;s votes. In addition to the show&apos;s prize of one million dollars and a recording contract with RCA, Clarkson secured a deal with Creative Artists Agency and several bookings, including the national American Idol tour and a performance of the national anthem at the September 11 commemoration at Washington, D.C.&apos;s Lincoln Memorial. &#xD;&#xA;Despite her newfound fame, Clarkson opted to remain in Texas rather than move to New York or Los Angeles. Her first single, &quot;A Moment Like This,&quot; was released just two weeks after she won the contest and quickly earned platinum sales. Clarkson&apos;s debut full-length, Thankful, was released in spring of 2003, just in time to coincide with the second season of American Idol (and right before the American Idol movie, From Justin to Kelly). Breakaway followed in late 2004 and was a huge success, selling over five million copies (making it the third best-selling album of 2005) and spawning the hit singles &quot;Because of You,&quot; &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes,&quot; and the enormously popular &quot;Since U Been Gone.&quot; That song and Breakaway earned Grammys for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album, respectively, at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in early 2006. Clarkson continued her busy touring schedule into the summer and announced plans for her third album.&#xD;&#xA;Clarkson released My December, the studio follow-up to Breakaway, in 2007. Notable as Clarkson&apos;s first foray into songwriting, My December featured a darker, more rock-oriented edge than its predecessor and even featured a guest appearance by punk icon and bassist Mike Watt. However, label exec Clive Davis openly disapproved of the album&apos;s direction, claiming that it lacked the commercial appeal of Breakaway. A public feud ensued, and Clarkson was dealt another blow when poor ticket sales resulted in the cancellation of her upcoming tour. The leadoff single &quot;Never Again&quot; nevertheless became a Top Ten pop hit, and My December climbed its way to platinum status by the year&apos;s end. &#xD;&#xA;Clarkson returned to the top of the charts in early 2009, when the sugary single &quot;My Life Would Suck Without You&quot; set a record for the largest leap to number one. Composed by songwriting vets Max Martin, Lukasz Gottwald, and Claude Kelly, the song also set the stage for her fourth album, All I Ever Wanted, whose pop-minded material was mostly produced by OneRepublic&apos;s Ryan Tedder. While touring in support of All I Ever Wanted, Clarkson announced that she had begun work on material for her follow-up. Eventually, she collaborated with a handful of writers and producers, including Claude Kelly and Howard Benson, as well as Jason Halbert, Rodney Jerkins, and others. In 2011 Clarkson released the resulting album, Stronger. Her fifth studio effort, the album featured the single &quot;Mr. Know It All.&quot; A Greatest Hits package followed in 2012, and Clarkson&apos;s first holiday album, Wrapped in Red, was released in October of 2013. As well as the usual selection of festive favorites, it included a number of newly written songs, including several co-penned by Clarkson herself. ~ Heather Phares" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/62001/thumb/1445625914" art="/library/metadata/62001/art/1445625914" addedAt="1438456733" updatedAt="1445625914">

  <Directory ratingKey="59745" key="/library/metadata/59745/children" type="artist" title="The Killers" titleSort="Killers" summary="Few bands in the early 2000s rose so quickly to the forefront of pop music as the Killers. With a mix of &apos;80s-styled synth pop and fashionista charm, the band&apos;s street-smart debut, Hot Fuss, became one of 2004&apos;s biggest releases, spawning four singles and catapulting the group -- particularly their dandyish, 22-year-old frontman, Brandon Flowers -- into the international spotlight. Hot Fuss reveled in the garish glitz of the band&apos;s native Las Vegas, spinning tales of androgynous girlfriends and illicit affairs to a public whose taste for revivalist dance-rock would prove to be virtually insatiable. Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, and the Bravery all benefited from such retro-minded interest, but the Killers unapologetically trumped them all -- even when their sophomore effort, Sam&apos;s Town, deemphasized the group&apos;s new wave sensibilities in favor of something more akin to the heartland rock of Bruce Springsteen and Rattle and Hum-era U2. &#xD;&#xA;Brandon Flowers (vocals/keyboards), David Keuning (guitar), Mark Stoermer (bass), and Ronnie Vannucci (drums) first came together in 2002, two years before Hot Fuss introduced their band to the public. Flowers had been sacked by his former synth pop band, Blush Response, after refusing to move to Los Angeles with the rest of his bandmates. Instead, he remained in Las Vegas, where he soon met local guitarist and Oasis fanatic Keuning. The two began collaborating on material; within weeks, they&apos;d composed their soon-to-be radio hit &quot;Mr. Brightside.&quot; Stoermer, a former medical courier, and Vannucci, a classical percussion major at UNLV, eventually joined the fray, and the band began playing small clubs in its hometown. A U.K. representative for Warner Bros. caught wind of the Killers&apos; brewing hype, and although he neglected to bring them on board the Warner roster, he did pass along their demo to the London-based indie imprint Lizard King. The British label quickly signed the Killers, who temporarily moved to the U.K. and issued a limited-edition single for &quot;Mr. Brightside.&quot; The Killers&apos; buzz had effectively traveled back across the Atlantic by fall 2003, and the band was offered a prime spot at the annual CMJ Music Marathon in New York City. A worldwide deal with Island followed shortly thereafter, positioning the Killers to join the ranks of Interpol, the Rapture, and the Strokes. &#xD;&#xA;Shared U.K. dates with British Sea Power and stellastarr* in 2004 gave the Killers an opportunity to showcase material from their debut album, Hot Fuss, which was released that June. &quot;Somebody Told Me,&quot; &quot;Mr. Brightside,&quot; &quot;Smile Like You Mean It,&quot; and &quot;All These Things That I&apos;ve Done&quot; all became worldwide chart hits, and Hot Fuss peaked at number seven on the Billboard Top 200. Buoyed by such success, Flowers became a sought-after media presence, often lashing out at such groups as the Bravery for riding his band&apos;s coattails into the mainstream. The frontman&apos;s confidence was not unwarranted; by 2006, Hot Fuss had earned five Grammy nominations and sold over five million copies. Rather than take a break to recover from their heavy tour regime, the Killers immediately set to work on a second album. A newly built facility at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas became the band&apos;s studio, and legendary producers Flood and Alan Moulder (who had previously worked together with U2 and the Smashing Pumpkins) were chosen to helm the controls. Instead of mining the glamour and glitz of their hometown (as they did to a successful extent on Hot Fuss), the group instead focused on nostalgia and the demise of old-fashioned American values, citing veteran songsmith Bruce Springsteen as a chief influence. &#xD;&#xA;The popularity generated by leadoff single &quot;When You Were Young&quot; led up to the highly anticipated release of Sam&apos;s Town in early October 2006. While the album did not match the popularity of the band&apos;s debut, it nevertheless sold 700,000 copies worldwide during its first week, eventually spawning three U.S. singles and gaining the Killers two additional Grammy nods. Sawdust, a collection of B-sides, rarities, and remixes, followed one year later, serving as a stopgap recording between the band&apos;s proper studio albums. The Killers then returned in 2008 with Day &amp; Age, which eschewed the Americana tangents of Sam&apos;s Town in favor of pop pastiches and sleek, oddball dance-rock. The band&apos;s return to the dancefloor was emboldened by Stuart Price, a veteran producer who had previously worked with Madonna and Gwen Stefani, and the Top 40 single &quot;Human&quot; helped the Killers continue their commercial streak. A lengthy tour carried the band into 2009, which also saw the release of the concert album Live from the Royal Albert Hall. Solo work comprised many of the next few years, including Brandon Flowers&apos; Flamingo, Ronnie Vannucci&apos;s Big Talk, and Mark Stoermer&apos;s Another Life. After reconvening in early 2011, the band got to work on its fourth studio album, enlisting a small army of notable producers, including Daniel Lanois, Steve Lillywhite, Damian Taylor, Stuart Price, and Brendan O&apos;Brien. The resulting Battle Born was released in September, 2012. In early 2013, the band announced that they would be releasing their first greatest-hits collection later that year. Entitled Direct Hits, the November release featured two newly recorded songs, &quot;Shot at Night&quot; and &quot;Just Another Girl,&quot; which were produced by M83 and Stuart Price, respectively. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59745/thumb/1445624979" art="/library/metadata/59745/art/1445624979" addedAt="1438448318" updatedAt="1445624979">

Quiet Is the New Loud was issued in early 2001 on Astralwerks. The album used many of the same tracks from the Kindercore release but reordered them and replaced a few with newer songs.

  <Directory ratingKey="59661" key="/library/metadata/59661/children" type="artist" title="Kings Of Leon" summary="Initially embraced as &quot;the Southern Strokes&quot; for their resurrection and reinvention of Dixie-styled rock &amp; roll, Kings of Leon steadily morphed themselves into an experimental rock outfit during the 2000s. The Tennessee-bred quartet debuted in 2003 with the Holy Roller Novocaine EP, whose blend of raw, unpolished boogie rock was further explored on their debut full-length, Youth &amp; Young Manhood. Such revivalist music was matched by a similarly revivalist appearance -- including long hair, mustaches, and tight-fitting denim -- and Kings of Leon experienced immediate popularity in the U.K. (where they would later enjoy platinum album sales, despite an initially lukewarm reception at home). As the band explored different sonic textures with subsequent releases, most notably on 2007&apos;s Because of the Times and 2008&apos;s Only by the Night, those tenuous links to the Strokes were finally dissolved.&#xD;&#xA;Comprised of three Followill brothers -- Caleb (guitar), Nathan (drums), and Jared (bass) -- as well as first cousin Matthew Followill (guitar), Kings of Leon formed in 2000. The Followill siblings had spent their youth traveling across America&apos;s heartland with their evangelist father, decamping at Pentecostal churches and tent revivals for several days at a time before moving onward. When their father resigned from the church and divorced his wife in 1997, the boys relocated to Nashville and embraced the rock music (not to mention the accompanying lifestyle) they&apos;d previously been denied. Cousin Matthew was added to the lineup, and a Southern garage rock sound quickly emerged. RCA took note, signing the band in 2001 and facilitating a partnership with Nashville-based producer Angelo Petraglia, who furthered the band&apos;s rock &amp; roll education and co-wrote the material for 2003&apos;s Holy Roller Novocaine EP. &#xD;&#xA;Tours across North America and the U.K. coincided with the release of the band&apos;s full-length debut, Youth &amp; Young Manhood, that same summer. Thanks to the popular single &quot;Molly&apos;s Chambers,&quot; the album found moderate success in the U.K. However, it was their sophomore effort, 2004&apos;s Aha Shake Heartbreak, that made them European stars, with three songs cracking the U.K. charts. The album saw an American release in February 2005, and Kings of Leon toured the country alongside U2 before retreating to work on their third effort. The darker, expansive Because of the Times followed in 2007. Featuring production from Ethan Johns (who had helmed the band&apos;s previous releases as well), the album proved to be the band&apos;s biggest release to date, debuting at number 25 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and topping the album charts in the U.K., Ireland, and New Zealand. &#xD;&#xA;Kings of Leon returned one year later with Only by the Night, a colossally popular album whose lead single, &quot;Sex on Fire,&quot; gave the band its first number one hit in the U.K. The album itself fared similarly well, topping the U.K. charts upon its release and debuting at number four in America. It eventually gained platinum status in eight countries, including America, and its success allowed the band to tour heavily throughout much of 2008 and 2009. Live at the O2 was released at the tail-end of 2009, capturing one of the band&apos;s midsummer performances in London. Kings of Leon briefly holed up in Manhattan&apos;s Avatar Studios to work on a fifth record, but they returned to the road during the summer of 2010, taking the opportunity to play some of their new material in concert. By the time the tour wrapped up in September, the group&apos;s newest single, &quot;Radioactive,&quot; had already been released. The accompanying album, Come Around Sundown, followed in October. The record was a worldwide hit and it reached number one in 15 countries, including the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia. &#xD;&#xA;Later that year they embarked on a marathon tour, however: a disastrous show in Texas resulted in frontman Caleb walking off the stage without returning for the end of the set. After this incident, the brothers decided to undertake a self-imposed hiatus in 2011 and cancelled the rest of the tour while the band attempted to reconcile the personal and group problems. In the time apart, bassist Jared released music with Mona frontman Nick Brown under the moniker Smoke &amp; Jackal, while Caleb found sobriety after moving to New York and the birth of his son. They returned to the band with a batch of new material and set to work on their sixth record, Mechanical Bull, which appeared in September of 2013.  ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59661/thumb/1445624955" art="/library/metadata/59661/art/1445624955" addedAt="1438447073" updatedAt="1445624955">

Blackburn is also a visual artist, working as part of design team, the Light Surgeons. The duo conceived Kinobe in west London in 1998, quickly assembling enough demo material for an album. As a result of this tape, they were signed to the dance imprint of Jive Records, Pepper. They released two limited edition EPs for the label during 1999, Planet Soup and Good Migrations. The following yearâs âSlip Into Something...â single featured a sample from From Here To Eternity, performed by Engelbert Humperdinck. The track became a staple of chillout compilations and was also widely used in television advertisements, notably one for Kronenbourg lager.&#xD;&#xD;&#xA;Blackburn and Waltersâ 2000 debut album, Soundphiles, featured lilting, funky rhythms, infectious bass grooves, epic strings and samples. One track, âTheatricksâ, featured vocals by dub poet Benjamin Zephaniah. The album drew very favourable comment from all of the UKâs dance music press, including comparisons to Air and soundtrack composer, John Barry. Several critics noted Kinobeâs perhaps quintessential British sound, a fearless juxtapositioning of seemingly disparate styles, carried out with touches of irony and humour. The duo repeated the formula to similar effect on subsequent albums Versebridgechorus? and Wide Open, the latter recorded in an 18th century summer house near Toulouse, France." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65008/thumb/1445627652" art="/library/metadata/65008/art/1445627652" addedAt="1438447108" updatedAt="1445627652">

  <Directory ratingKey="57841" key="/library/metadata/57841/children" type="artist" title="KT Tunstall" summary="Born in 1975, Scottish singer/songwriter KT Tunstall -- not short for anything, the KT is just an alternate spelling of Katie -- comes from the quaint university town of St. Andrews. Due in part by being adopted at birth, her imagination and creative side flourished from early on as she thought about how her life could have gone in any given direction. As she was growing up, her physicist father would take Tunstall and her brothers into the St. Andrews observatory to look at the sky, thus fueling her youthful love for space and sci-fi. It wasn&apos;t until discovering hair metal through a brother that music really did start to become important to her, and when it did, her affection for spacy things was reflected in her favorite album, David Bowie&apos;s Hunky Dory. &#xD;&#xA;Tunstall picked up playing piano and flute at a young age, learned to sing by listening to Ella Fitzgerald, and began writing her own songs in her mid-teens. At 16, she taught herself the guitar and continued to hone her writing skills with sentimental love songs. A scholarship to the Kent School, a private prep school in Connecticut, brought her experiences outside of St. Andrews and Scotland. She formed her first band there, the Happy Campers, and enjoyed seeing shows by 10,000 Maniacs and the Grateful Dead. Next came a music course at London&apos;s Royal Holloway College, before heading back home and immersing herself in the local grassroots scene that birthed bands like the Fence Collective and the Beta Band. Around this time, KT was also listening to a lot of Billie Holiday, Lou Reed, and James Brown, among others, and soon formed a group with the Fence Collective&apos;s Pip Dylan. &#xD;&#xA;Fast forward a few years. KT returned to London and began writing more songs, many of which would appear on her subsequent album. She entered a backwoods Wiltshire studio with minimal instruments in tow and Steve Osborne (U2, New Order) at the controls. The end result was her glossy debut, Eye to the Telescope, released in the U.K. in January 2005 on Relentless. Highlighting her soulful voice, sassy attitude, and earthy songwriting approach, comparisons to Dido, Fiona Apple, and Kate Melua soon sparked. Following the record&apos;s release, Tunstall hit all over Europe, including shows supporting Joss Stone and singing with Oi Va Voi. Feeling an acoustic guitar was sometimes too limiting, her live show incorporated the use of an Akai Headrush foot pedal that allowed her to spot-record multiple times (loop each section continuously), thus turning Tunstall into her own one-woman backup band. &#xD;&#xA;Early 2006 continued to be bright for Tunstall as Telescope was released in the United States that February, and she won Best British Female Solo Artist at the Brits. Meanwhile, her first single, &quot;Black Horse &amp; the Cherry Tree,&quot; continued to do very well on American adult alternative radio. KT Tunstall&apos;s Acoustic Extravaganza was issued that fall; it included acoustic tracks (both new and old) recorded the previous Christmas along with a bonus making-of DVD. In 2007, Tunstall returned to the scene with her poppier Drastic Fantastic. Three years later, she recorded her third album, Tiger Suit, at Berlin&apos;s Hansa studio, the same place where Bowie recorded Heroes. The album appeared in the fall of 2010. She followed the set with Live in London, March 2011, and later in the year, with an EP entitled The Scarlet Tulip, which was recorded in her home studio with co-producer Luke Bulle. After a break from touring, Tunstall re-entered the studio in late 2012 and recorded her fifth album. Invisible Empire // Crescent Moon appeared in June of 2013. ~ Corey Apar" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/57841/thumb/1445624336" art="/library/metadata/57841/art/1445624336" addedAt="1438456555" updatedAt="1445624336">

  <Directory ratingKey="60107" key="/library/metadata/60107/children" type="artist" title="Kula Shaker" summary="By reviving the swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-&apos;60s psychedelia and infusing it with George Harrison&apos;s Indian mysticism and spirituality, Kula Shaker became one of the most popular British bands of the immediate post-Brit-pop era. More musically adept and experimental than Cast, Kula Shaker nevertheless worked the same vaguely spiritual lyrical territory, but musically they brought the overpowering rush of Oasis to psychedelia, a genre that the Mancunians had previously avoided. Their classicist approach to rock &amp; roll earned them both critical praise and derision, as they quickly rocketed to the top of the British charts.&#xD;&#xA;Led by vocalist/guitarist Crispian Mills (born January 18, 1973; the son of &apos;60s actress Hayley Mills and film director Roy Boulting), Kula Shaker were initially a psychedelic quartet called the Kays, which formed in 1993. In addition to Mills, the Kays featured his teenage friend Alonza Bevan. The two had previously played together in a band named Objects of Desire; during that time they also ran a psychedelic nightclub in the back of an ice rink. Following the dissolution of Objects of Desire, Mills made a spiritual pilgrimage to India, and upon returning he formed the Kays with bassist Bevan, drummer Paul Winter-Hart, and vocalist Saul Dimont. Within a year, Dimont had left and organist Jay Darlington had joined the band; prior to joining the group, Darlington had played in several mod revival bands. After spending two years touring and recording, releasing two EPs on Gut Reaction Records, the group had not made any headway. According to Mills, the band changed its name and direction in the spring of 1995, when he had an epiphany that the group should be called Kula Shaker after a ninth century emperor and pursue a more spiritual direction. For the next three months, they performed as Kula Shaker, and they quickly received a record contract with Columbia, which was eager to sign another band that had the multi-platinum crossover appeal of Oasis.&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Grateful When You&apos;re Dead,&quot; Kula Shaker&apos;s debut single, was released in the spring of 1996 to moderate success, but it was the follow-up single, &quot;Tattva,&quot; that established the band. Peaking at number four on the charts, &quot;Tattva&quot; had a chorus that was adapted from an ancient Sanskrit text and a colorful organ and guitar riff, which essentially encapsulated the band&apos;s sound. The single also set the stage for the band&apos;s debut, K, which appeared in September of 1996. Upon its release, K entered the charts at number one, becoming the fastest-selling British debut album since Oasis&apos; Definitely Maybe. The album received reviews that ranged from enthusiastic to derisive, but the band continued to gain momentum, which eventually translated to a strong word of mouth in America. Kula Shaker weren&apos;t able to replicate their British success in America, but &quot;Tattva&quot; became a Top Ten modern rock hit in late 1996, and the group received uniformly positive reviews. Peasants, Pigs &amp; Astronauts followed in 1999. &#xD;&#xA;Despite Peasants, Pigs &amp; Astronauts cracking the Top Ten charts, Kula Shaker ended up parting ways in 1999. Mills worked on solo material that never fully emerged and eventually formed the trio the Jeevas with former Straw members Andy Nixon and Dan McKinna. The group released two albums and toured. As for the other Kula Shakers, bassist Bevan joined guitarist Johnny Marr &amp; the Healers while keyboardist Darlington joined up with Oasis. Drummer Winter-Hart joined the band Thirteen:13 and played with various other groups, including Aqualung.&#xD;&#xA;Around 2004, a charity album that Mills was producing for a school in California brought about a brief Kula Shaker reunion of sorts, with the band (minus Darlington, who declined involvement) contributing one song to the project. Then, in 2006, Kula Shaker announced they were officially reuniting, this time with new keyboardist Harry Broadbent. After a comeback tour, Kula Shaker released their third full-length studio album, Strangefolk, in 2007. The band began work on its fourth album in 2008; however, label issues stalled the proceedings and delayed the release of Pilgrims Progress until 2010. One year later, the band celebrated K&apos;s 15-year anniversary by releasing a multi-disc CD/DVD version of the album, titled K-15. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60107/thumb/1445625083" art="/library/metadata/60107/art/1445625083" addedAt="1438447123" updatedAt="1445625083">

  <Directory ratingKey="61965" key="/library/metadata/61965/children" type="artist" title="Kylie Minogue" summary="On the one hand, in the pop music arena, worldbeaters such as Kylie Minogue are few and far between. Singers and performers of her stature and popularity rarely maintain their power for as long as she has. Her streaks of number one singles in both Australia and the U.K. are nearly insurmountable. And yet, on the other hand, her inability to really crack open the American pop market over the course of her career is a story that is heard all too often from groups hailing from nations as pop powerful as Australia and the U.K. Eventually, with the hugely successful &quot;Can&apos;t Get You Out of My Head,&quot; Kylie would rattle the American pop psyche, reminding the rather insular scene that the bubbly girl who had first made waves with the 1987 cover of &quot;The Loco Motion&quot; had developed into a stylish, experienced, and able pop performer with a clear agenda -- both musically and visually -- and the chops to match. To focus on Minogue&apos;s American problem would only be looking at a small fraction of the larger story.&#xD;&#xA;Born in Melbourne, Australia on May 28, 1968, Kylie began acting in television dramas at the age of 12. Although the small roles brought her a fair bit of exposure, it was her 1986 debut on the insanely popular soap Neighbours that catapulted her to stardom. In Australia, Minogue&apos;s role as the tomboy Charlene won her a number of awards, but in Britain, the exploits of that character and her love interest -- played by the actor Jason Donovan -- attracted record numbers of television viewers, and made the Aussie drama one of the most watched shows in the U.K. Understanding Minogue&apos;s megastar potential, as well as her ability to vamp and sing, Mushroom Records signed her to a contract in 1987. Her success was immediate, as her debut single, &quot;The Loco Motion&quot; (a cover of the 1962 Little Eva hit) rocketed to number one. &#xD;&#xA;With Australia firmly behind her move to pop music, Kylie headed to England and partnered with the production team of Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman. The first track that the group released with Kylie, &quot;I Should Be So Lucky,&quot; would dominate the Australian charts, as well as a number of charts in Europe. Her pop status was further consolidated with her debut album, 1988&apos;s Kylie. While she was blazing a trail across the globe, her success in America at first seemed possible. MTV was showing &quot;The Loco Motion&quot; with regularity, and it even hit the number three spot on the Billboard chart, while &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; managed to make a few waves as well. But it was not to be, as the American market seemed to balk, not releasing anything after her second album until 2001. As the &apos;80s drew to a close, Minogue&apos;s stature worldwide only grew. Her duet with Jason Donovan, &quot;Especially for You,&quot; sold over a million copies in 1989, even while being critically panned. A second full-length, Enjoy Yourself, was also released that year, along with a handful of singles that managed to further dominate charts in both hemispheres. In the midst of this pop success, Minogue also managed to appear in her first feature film, The Delinquents.&#xD;&#xA;Many things would change for her in the frenetic decade of the &apos;90s. She began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one. Her relationship with the late frontman of INXS, Michael Hutchence, and her shedding of the near-virginal faÃ§ade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music. Released in 1990, Rhythm of Love, its world-wide hit single, &quot;Better the Devil You Know,&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;Shocked,&quot; took her out of the stifling world of teen pop and brought her into the more adult world of dance music and nightclubs. Her career was not without its ebbs, however. As she began to flex a bit more creative muscle, her relationship with Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman began to grow tiresome. Their sound had dominated for a number of years on both sides of the Atlantic (America seemed to take more to their other star, Rick Astley), but the scene was beginning to move on, and Kylie&apos;s fourth and final album with Mushroom and the production team, Let&apos;s Get to It, would sell disappointingly. Freed from the yoke of both a production team and a mainstream pop label, Minogue began a long trend of collaborating with up-and-coming and hot producers and songwriters, which not only allowed her to roll with cultural trends and stay current in an extremely fussy and fickle genre, but allowed her to branch out into new areas of performance unheard of by most pop singers of her style.&#xD;&#xA;Now signed to the dance label Deconstruction, Minogue released a much more mature and stylish dance-pop record in 1994&apos;s Kylie Minogue. The reviews were not all positive, but the desire to show growth and maturity was evident in spades. The singles &quot;Confide in Me&quot; and &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; were slicker, more stylish, and less hooky than anything she had previously recorded. While the record sold well, and Kylie made more movie appearances (1994&apos;s Street Fighter and 1996&apos; Bio-Dome) the next couple of years were fairly quiet except for the hit single (and seemingly unlikely collaboration) with Nick Cave entitled &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow.&quot; A dark ballad (with a video based on the Millais painting Ophelia) about a murder -- the duet featured Cave as the murderer singing his point of view, and Minogue as the victim singing hers -- the single was widely successful in Australia and the U.K, earning Kylie a new set of fans and a new sense of respect for the diminutive Minogue from more arty quarters. &#xD;&#xA;Her eagerness to expand on this collaboration led to the work that would make up her 1997 album, Impossible Princess. While the lead single, the more rock-tinged &quot;Some Kind of Bliss,&quot; was the result of working with James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore of Manic Street Preachers, the rest of the album (for the most part) consisted of further collaborations (David Seaman, for instance) and efforts to expand on the dance-pop that was Kylie&apos;s bread and butter. The album, soon retitled Kylie Minogue in England due to the death of Princess Diana, was successful, but her attempt at developing her sound met firm resistance critically, with many radio stations and journalists writing her off, figuring her career had run its course. Obviously, this was not to be, as Kylie toured the world for the album, selling out stadiums (as usual) and appearing in a number of specialty concerts over the next two years. &#xD;&#xA;In 1999, having been dropped from Deconstruction but signing to Parlophone, Minogue shed the indie influences that guided Impossible Princess and set about creating dance-pop that was more disco than anything in her catalog. The resulting album, Light Years, and its lead single, &quot;Spinning Around,&quot; were huge successes, bringing her critical acclaim for returning to what many considered her calling (big pop and dance numbers) and winning herself a new generation of fans, then currently worked up by the renaissance of pure dance-pop that was the order of the day at the onset of the 21st century.&#xD;&#xA;Her place in pop music history would be consolidated in 2001, and she would be reintroduced to America after more than a decade as well. That year&apos;s album, Fever, and its massively successful (and aptly titled) single, &quot;Can&apos;t Get You Out of My Head,&quot; were the first to be released in the U.S. since Enjoy Yourself, and the single managed to chart stateside at number three. Even the Grammys began to recognize Minogue, as the first of many nominations (eventually she would win for &quot;Come into My World&quot; in 2002) finally happened that year. While her next album, 2003&apos;s Body Language, was not as big a seller as Fever, it was another successful attempt at broadening her sound (with electro and hip-hop for instance) and winning more fans. A greatest-hits package (her second), 2004&apos;s Ultimate Kylie, acted as a catalyst for her world-wide Showgirl tour, but that was to be set aside as a diagnosis of breast cancer sidelined her. &#xD;&#xA;In 2005, she underwent successful surgery and follow-up chemotherapy. Eventually making a full recovery, Minogue started back slowly, but would eventually finish her Showgirl tour, and in 2007, released her tenth album, X. While some were put off by her lack of introspection on the record, it was well received and sold well enough to convince Kylie that 2009 was the time to undertake her first tour of the United States. Although limited to a few dates and select cities, the North American jaunt was a rousing success, and an Internet-exclusive album of the New York show was made available at the end of that year. As X was making waves in 2008, Kylie was also honored by Queen Elizabeth with an OBE (Order of the British Empire) for her services to music. Kylie released her 11th full-length, Aphrodite (a set executive produced by Stuart Price), in 2010. That same year she guested on songs by Hurts (&quot;Devotion&quot;) and Taio Cruz (&quot;Higher&quot;), and released a holiday EP titled A Kylie Christmas. In 2012 she celebrated her 25th year in the music biz with a greatest[hits collection (The Best of Kylie Minogue), a new single (&quot;Timebomb&quot;), an exhaustive singles collection (K25), and an album of her hits reimagined for a small band and orchestra (The Abbey Road Sessions.) She also found time to restart her acting career with an appearance in Jack &amp; Diane and a leading role in the acclaimed Holy Motors. ~ Chris True" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61965/thumb/1445625950" art="/library/metadata/61965/art/1445625950" addedAt="1438449566" updatedAt="1445625950">

  <Directory ratingKey="61602" key="/library/metadata/61602/children" type="artist" title="Lady Gaga" summary="Glamorously gaudy, a self-made post-modern diva stitched together from elements of Madonna, David Bowie, and Freddie Mercury, Lady Gaga was the first true millennial superstar. Mastering the constant connection of the internet era, Gaga generated countless mini-sensations through her style, her videos, and her music, cultivating a devoted audience she dubbed &quot;Little Monsters.&quot; But it wasn&apos;t just a cult that turned her 2008 manifesto The Fame into a self-fulfilling prophecy: Gaga crossed over into the mainstream, ushering out one pop epoch and kick-starting a new one, quickly making such turn-of-the-century stars as Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears seem old-fashioned, quite a trick for any artist to pull off, but especially impressive for an artist who specialized in repurposing the past -- particularly the &apos;80s -- for present use, creating sustainable pop for a digital world. &#xD;&#xA;Perhaps unsurprisingly given her flair for grand gestures, Lady Gaga has deep roots in drama. Born Stefani Germanotta on March 28, 1986, the future Gaga played piano as a child and pursued musical theater in high school, regularly auditioning for New York-based television shows, notably landing a background role for a 2001 episode of The Sopranos. At the age of 17 she enrolled at New York University&apos;s Tisch School of the Arts in their Collaborative Arts Project 21. As she studied, she continued to eke her way into show biz, winding up with an appearance on MTV&apos;s short-lived post-Punk&apos;d reality show Boiling Points in 2005. Not long afterward, she left school so she could concentrate on her music, fronting a band called SGBand, which released two EPs prior to splitting. Germanotta then teamed with producer Rob Fusari, a collaboration that produced not only her stage name Lady Gaga, but recordings that led to her signing with Def Jam in the fall of 2006. Her association with Def Jam was short-lived: the label dropped her early in 2007. Gaga rebounded by working with performance artist Lady Starlight, the two developing the Lady Gaga &amp; the Starlight Revue, a tongue-in-cheek neo-burlesque act that gained positive press and proved to be her last stop before signing with Interscope later in 2007. While at Interscope she created a bond with Akon, who convinced Interscope head Jimmy Iovine to have her co-sign with his Kon Live imprint, and then Gaga began working with producer/songwriter RedOne, a union that led to the songs that would bring her fame: &quot;Just Dance,&quot; &quot;LoveGame,&quot; and &quot;Poker Face.&quot; These songs formed the foundation of The Fame, the debut album that appeared in August 2008.&#xD;&#xA;Initially, Lady Gaga had greater success in Europe, thanks in large part to the &quot;Just Dance&quot; single, which earned club play in the U.S. and chart placement in other territories. Gaga&apos;s march toward the top of the American chart was slow but &quot;Just Dance&quot; reached the peak position in January 2009, followed swiftly by &quot;Poker Face,&quot; the single that firmly pushed her into the mainstream, its popularity growing so large it often functioned as a punch line on TV in addition to winning a Grammy for Best Dance Recording. &quot;LoveGame&quot; and &quot;Paparazzi&quot; also appeared as singles before Gaga released The Fame Monster in time for the holiday season of 2009. The mini-LP, available separately and as a package with The Fame, contained the single &quot;Bad Romance&quot; whose popularity soon rivaled &quot;Poker Face&quot; and helped kickstart a stellar year for Gaga in 2010. That year, the hit singles &quot;Bad Romance,&quot; &quot;Alejandro,&quot; and the BeyoncÃ© duet &quot;Telephone,&quot; along with the successful Monster Ball Tour, put Lady Gaga front and center with the public as she worked on her sophomore album, announcing the May release of Born This Way on New Year&apos;s Day 2011. The steady march to its summer unveiling was preceded by the release of three singles --&quot;Born This Way,&quot; &quot;Judas,&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Glory&quot;-- all leading up to the highly anticipated Born This Way. Arriving to mixed reviews, the album was a hit but didn&apos;t quite live up to its high expectations, yet it produced more genuine hits with &quot;Marry the Night.&quot; A full remix of the album, naturally called Born This Way: The Remix, appeared at the end of the year, as did a holiday television special called A Very Gaga Thanksgiving and an accompanying EP, A Very Gaga Holiday. &#xD;&#xA;Gaga continued to promote Born This Way throughout 2012, appearing at various star-studded events and television programs while continuing her international tour. The tour came to a halt in February of 2013, when she announced that she had hip surgery to repair a labral tear. As she was healing, she worked on her third album, Artpop. Preceded by the singles &quot;Applause&quot; and &quot;Do What U Want,&quot; the latter a duet with R. Kelly, Artpop was released in early November 2013. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61602/thumb/1445625811" art="/library/metadata/61602/art/1445625811" addedAt="1438454793" updatedAt="1445625811">

  <Directory ratingKey="61559" key="/library/metadata/61559/children" type="artist" title="Ladyhawke" summary="New Zealand-born Phillipa &quot;Pip&quot; Brown got her start as lead guitarist in the Wellington-based band Two Lane Blacktop in 2001. Just as the group was set to head to Australia to tour with Modey Lemon, they suddenly dissolved. Brown decided to continue on with the plan to travel to Australia, and ended up relocating to Melbourne in 2003. Once there she met up with Nick Littlemore of the Sydney-based band Pnau (and later Empire of the Sun) and he asked her to play in his new band Teenager. They gigged together for a few years, releasing the album Thirteen in 2006 before, at Littlemore&apos;s urging, Brown set off on a solo career. Dubbing herself Ladyhawke after the 1985 Richard Donner movie, she began recording her solo album with producers Pascal Gabriel and Hannah Robinson. Released by Modular in 2008, Ladyhawke was a hit in Brown&apos;s native country, and the modern pop sound and catchy hooks made it a success elsewhere (namely Australia and the U.K.) as well. After a year spent touring and promoting the album, Brown returned to the studio with Gabriel to work on a follow-up, but the sessions fell apart due to Brown&apos;s post-tour exhaustion. After taking a break, the pair began working in Gabriel&apos;s studio in France; in 2012, her second album, Anxiety, was co-released by Modular and the rejuvenated Casablanca label. The record&apos;s lyrics dealt honestly with the Asperger&apos;s Syndrome that Brown was diagnosed with in 2006 and featured a stripped-down feel that leaned more toward the harder edges of the &apos;90s alternative rock scene, rather than the more dancefloor-oriented, &apos;80s-influenced sound of her debut. ~ Tim Sendra" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61559/thumb/1445625773" art="/library/metadata/61559/art/1445625773" addedAt="1438451869" updatedAt="1445625773">

  <Directory ratingKey="59613" key="/library/metadata/59613/children" type="artist" title="Lifehouse" summary="Led by singer/songwriter Jason Wade, Lifehouse emerged in the early 2000s with a commercial blend of pop/rock melody and throaty, post-grunge vocals. Wade, who originally tagged the band Blyss upon its inception in 1996, was raised by missionary parents in a variety of locales. He eventually settled in Los Angeles with his mother and took a keen interest in songwriting. Bassist Sergio Andrade lived next door, and the two spent hours in Wade&apos;s garage, fine-tuning their original compositions and laying the brickwork for Lifehouse&apos;s accessible sound. Those rehearsals paved the way for a self-released album, Diff&apos;s Lucky Band, as well as a series of shows at church worship services. Lifehouse resisted the temptation to become a full-fledged Christian band, however, and instead signed a contract with Dreamworks Records as an alternative rock trio. Drummer Jon Palmer completed the lineup. &#xD;&#xA;No Name Face marked the band&apos;s official debut in the fall of 2000. The album enjoyed double-platinum sales on the strength of &quot;Hanging by a Moment,&quot; which was the most played radio track of 2001. In a market dominated by teen pop, Lifehouse stood out as champions of guitar-based music, and their unexpected success drew them back inside the studio to work on a follow-up album. With Brendan O&apos;Brien handling production duties, Wade led his band through the recording of Stanley Climbfall during the spring and summer of 2002. The record was released on Dreamworks the following September, but it failed to match the sales of its predecessor. Lifehouse&apos;s lineup splintered soon after, with Andrade exiting the group to pursue alternate projects. &#xD;&#xA;Wade pieced together a revised Lifehouse and returned in early 2005 with a self-titled third album. For the touring that followed its release, Wade and percussionist Rick Woolstenhulme were joined by former AM Radio bassist/vocalist Bryce Soderberg, who remained with the group for its return to alternative rock on 2007&apos;s Who We Are. Lifehouse and Who We Are proved to be fairly popular releases, with both albums going gold thanks to a trio of Top 40 singles: &quot;First Time,&quot; &quot;You and Me,&quot; and &quot;Whatever It Takes.&quot; Smoke &amp; Mirrors appeared three years later, sporting a collaboration with rapper/songwriter Kevin Rudolf on the leadoff single &quot;Halfway Gone.&quot; Debuting at number six on the Billboard Top 200, Smoke &amp; Mirrors was a successful record and, after a supporting tour, the group entered the studio once again with producer Jude Cole (he helmed S&amp;M) to record its sixth album. Entitled Almeria, the record appeared in December 2012; it was preceded by the single &quot;Between the Raindrops,&quot; a duet with pop singer Natasha Bedingfield. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59613/thumb/1445624915" art="/library/metadata/59613/art/1445624915" addedAt="1438457356" updatedAt="1445624915">

  <Directory ratingKey="59599" key="/library/metadata/59599/children" type="artist" title="Lily Allen" summary="With her omnivorous musical tastes and cheeky attitude, London-based pop singer/songwriter Lily Allen made a name for herself almost as soon as she released her demos on the Internet. The daughter of comedian Keith Allen, Lily spent most of her childhood bouncing from one school to another -- in fact, she attended 13 different schools between the ages of five and 15. This constant moving meant she didn&apos;t have much of a chance to make lasting friendships, so Allen entertained herself with books and, especially, music: she listened to everything from T. Rex, the Specials, and the Slits to the Happy Mondays and drum&apos;n&apos;bass, and even ran away to see the Glastonbury Festival when she was 14. After she left school a year later, she realized that music was the only career for her. Allen concentrated on her songwriting and singing, developing a style that was equally sweet and bratty; late in 2005, she set up a MySpace page and posted demos of her songs, as both individual tracks and as part of two limited-edition &quot;mixtapes&quot; that also featured tracks by Dizzee Rascal, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Ludacris. The critical acclaim for her work fueled Allen&apos;s publicity, leading to tens of thousands of friends on MySpace, airplay on BBC Radio One, and a record deal with Regal/Parlophone before the end of 2005. &#xD;&#xA;Allen began working on her full-length album with producers such as Greg Kurstin, Mark Ronson (with whom she also collaborated on a cover of the Kaiser Chiefs&apos; &quot;Oh My God&quot; that appeared on her second mixtape), and Futurecut, and released a limited-edition 7&quot; of LDN as her debut single in spring 2006. Both LDN and Smile, which followed that summer, were chart successes, with the former reaching number seven on the U.K. chart and the latter hitting number one the week it debuted. Hot on the heels of Smile came Allen&apos;s first full-length, Alright, Still, which she supported with a slew of dates stretching out to the end of the year. Despite the speed of her success, Allen continued to update her MySpace page with amusing blog rants, including one about her June 2006 appearance on Top of the Pops that berated the lead singer of the Kooks for &quot;wearing broken straw hats and dark sunglasses&quot; indoors and Dirty Pretty Things for having &quot;organic sliced bread on the rider.&quot; Allen rang in 2007 with more tour dates, including gigs in Japan, Australia, and the U.S., and the U.S. release of Alright, Still. She also earned nominations for British Breakthrough Act and British Female Solo for that year&apos;s Brit Awards, while &quot;Smile&quot; and Alright, Still were nominated for British Single and British Album, respectively.&#xD;&#xA;Allen spent most of 2007 touring, but also collaborated with Dizzee Rascal on Maths and English&apos;s duet &quot;Wanna Be&quot; and provided vocals on Basement Jaxx&apos;s Crazy Itch Radio. Allen&apos;s personal life and side projects were nearly as prominent as her music career, with her relationship with Chemical Brother Ed Simons and her subsequent miscarriage making headlines in late 2007 and early 2008. In February 2008, Allen embarked on a talk show on BBC Three, Lily Allen and Friends, which lasted through that April. That month, Allen posted two new demos on her MySpace page, including &quot;GWB,&quot; which was about President George Bush; for her second album, she worked with producer Greg Kurstin of the Bird and the Bee, and co-wrote several songs with him instead of just providing the lyrics. She also worked on songs with Jamie Reynolds of the Klaxons and wrote a song about comedian James Corden for the 2008 Shockwaves Awards. Another new song, &quot;Everyone&apos;s at It,&quot; debuted that fall, and Allen courted controversy again with an unauthorized cover of Britney Spears&apos; &quot;Womanizer&quot; that December. It&apos;s Not Me, It&apos;s You, which covered topics like drugs, fame, family, and society, arrived early in 2009, preceded by the single The Fear. Despite the album&apos;s success, which included platinum certification in the UK and debuting at the top of the charts in the UK, Canada and Australia (and at number five in the US), in September 2009 Allen did not renew her record contract and took a hiatus from making music. &#xD;&#xA;She remained busy, founding her own label In the Name Of, which included Cults on its roster, writing songs for the musical version of Bridget Jones&apos; Diary and starting a family with her boyfriend Sam Cooper, whom she married in June 2011. The following year, she announced she would be professionally known as Lily Rose Cooper and that she was in the studio working on new music with longtime producer Greg Kurstin. Cooper also appeared on Pink&apos;s 2012 album, The Truth About Love.~ Heather Phares" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59599/thumb/1445624935" art="/library/metadata/59599/art/1445624935" addedAt="1438454747" updatedAt="1445624935">

  <Directory ratingKey="64864" key="/library/metadata/64864/children" type="artist" title="Linkin Park" summary="Although rooted in alternative metal, Linkin Park became one of the most successful acts of the 2000s by welcoming elements of hip-hop, modern rock, and atmospheric electronica into their music. The band&apos;s rise was indebted to the aggressive rap-rock movement made popular by the likes of Korn and Limp Bizkit, a movement that paired grunge&apos;s alienation with a bold, buzzing soundtrack. Linkin Park added a unique spin to that formula, however, focusing as much on the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda as the band&apos;s muscled instrumentation, which layered DJ effects atop heavy, processed guitars. While the group&apos;s sales never eclipsed those of its tremendously successful debut, Hybrid Theory, few alt-metal bands rivaled Linkin Park during the band&apos;s heyday. &#xD;&#xA;Drummer Rob Bourdon, guitarist Brad Delson, and MC/vocalist Mike Shinoda attended high school in Southern California, where they formed the rap-rock band Xero in 1996. Bassist Dave &quot;Phoenix&quot; Farrell, singer Mark Wakefield, and DJ/art student Joseph Hahn joined soon after, and the band courted various labels while playing hometown shows in Los Angeles. Few companies expressed interest in Xero&apos;s self-titled demo tape, however, prompting Wakefield to leave the lineup (he would later resurface as the manager for Taproot). Hybrid Theory became the band&apos;s temporary moniker in 1998 as replacement singer Chester Bennington climbed aboard, and the revised band soon settled on a final name: Linkin Park, a misspelled reference to Lincoln Park in Santa Monica. With Bennington and Shinoda sharing vocal duties, the musicians now wielded enough power to distinguish themselves from the wave of nu-metal outfits that had appeared during the decade&apos;s latter half. Warner Bros. vice president Jeff Blue took note and signed Linkin Park in 1999, sending the band into the studio with Don Gilmore shortly thereafter. &#xD;&#xA;Linkin Park titled their debut album Hybrid Theory, a tribute to the band&apos;s past, and released the record during the fall of 2000. &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;In the End&quot; were massive radio hits; the latter song even topped the U.S. Modern Rock chart while peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, an example of the band&apos;s crossover appeal. Linkin Park joined the Family Values Tour and also played shows with Cypress Hill, leading the group to log over 320 shows in 2001 alone. Come January 2002, Hybrid Theory had received three Grammy nominations and sold over seven million copies. (Sales later topped ten million, earning the album &quot;diamond status&quot; and making Hybrid Theory one of the most successful debuts ever.) Despite their meteoric rise, however, Linkin Park spent the remainder of the year holed up in the recording studio, again working with producer Don Gilmore on a follow-up album. Meanwhile, the timely summer release of Reanimation helped appease the band&apos;s eager audience, offering remixed versions of Hybrid Theory&apos;s tracks. &#xD;&#xA;A proper sophomore effort, Meteora, arrived in March 2003, featuring a heavier sound and stronger elements of rap-rock. Although the record spawned several modern rock hits, songs such as &quot;Numb,&quot; &quot;Somewhere I Belong,&quot; and &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; furthered the band&apos;s crossover appeal by simultaneously charting on the Hot 100. Linkin Park once again supported the album with ample touring, including performances with the second annual Projekt Revolution Tour (the band&apos;s own traveling festival, which originally launched in 2002) and additional shows with the likes of Metallica and Limp Bizkit. Live in Texas was released to document the band&apos;s strength as a touring act, and the bandmates tackled various personal projects before beginning work on a second remix project. &#xD;&#xA;Released in 2004, Collision Course found the band collaborating with king-of-the-mountain rapper Jay-Z, resulting in a number of mashups that sampled from both artists&apos; catalogs. Collision Course topped the charts upon its release, the first EP to do so since Alice in Chains&apos; Jar of Flies, and Jay-Z furthered his association with the band by asking co-founder Mike Shinoda to explore the possibility of a solo hip-hop project. He did, dubbing the project Fort Minor and releasing The Rising Tied in 2005 with Jay-Z as executive producer. Linkin Park then reconvened in 2006 to begin work on a third studio album, which saw Shinoda sharing production credits with Rick Rubin. The resulting Minutes to Midnight arrived in 2007, debuting at number one in several countries and spawning the Top Ten single &quot;What I&apos;ve Done.&quot; In 2010 the band teamed up with Rubin again to produce its fourth studio album, A Thousand Suns. The following year, Chester Bennington stated the band&apos;s desire to focus more on putting out new material rather than maintaining an exhaustive touring schedule, with the band having a goal of releasing a new album every 18 months. Linkin Park made good on that promise in 2012 with their Rick Rubin-produced fifth album, Living Things. Upon its June release, the album debuted at the top of the Billboard charts, selling over 223,000 copies in its first week; it would soon be certified gold. &#xD;&#xA;As Linkin Park began work on its sixth studio album in the spring of 2013, Bennington announced that he was replacing Scott Weiland as the lead vocalist of Stone Temple Pilots; he was not leaving Linkin Park, but rather, planned to be in both groups simultaneously. Bennington underscored his commitment to both bands in October of 2013 by releasing his debut EP with STP, High Rise, and with Linkin Park, which released the remix album Recharged that same month. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64864/thumb/1445627610" art="/library/metadata/64864/art/1445627610" addedAt="1438447316" updatedAt="1445627610">

Ben Knox Miller and Jeff Prystowsky -- both students at Brown University, as well as late-night DJs at the school&apos;s radio station -- formed the Low Anthem in 2006, drawing upon their background as classical composers to help mold the group&apos;s eclectic music. Jocie Adams joined one year later, and the group began widening its arsenal of instruments accordingly, utilizing everything from World War I pump organs to crotales in the process. After making its independent debut with 2007&apos;s What the Crow Brings, the band rang in 2008 by temporarily relocating to Block Island -- a remote location 12 miles off the Rhode Island coast -- to record an album with producer Jesse Lauter. The stark, serene environment proved to be appropriate for the music, which the band initially self-released under the title Oh My God, Charlie Darwin. &#xD;&#xA;As their buzz continued to build, the Low Anthem signed a contract with Nonesuch Recordings and reissued Oh My God in 2009, supporting the release with a string of performances at summer festivals. Multi-instrumentalist Mat Davidson was added to the lineup later that year, joining the Low Anthem&apos;s ranks one month before they headed to Central Falls, RI, to record a third album. Setting up a makeshift studio inside an abandoned pasta sauce factory, the group recorded Smart Flesh over a period of three months, making good use of the building&apos;s carvernous, resonant spaces.

  <Directory ratingKey="61400" key="/library/metadata/61400/children" type="artist" title="Madonna" summary="After stars reach a certain point, it&apos;s easy to forget what they became famous for and concentrate solely on their personas. Madonna is such a star. She rocketed to stardom so quickly in 1984 that it obscured most of her musical virtues. Appreciating her music became even more difficult as the decade wore on, as discussing her lifestyle became more common. However, one of Madonna&apos;s greatest achievements is how she has manipulated the media and the public with her music, her videos, her publicity, and her sexuality. Arguably, Madonna was the first female pop star to have complete control of her music and image.&#xD;&#xA;She moved from her native Michigan to New York in 1977 with dreams of becoming a ballet dancer. She studied with choreographer Alvin Ailey and modeled. In 1979, she became part of the Patrick Hernandez Revue, a disco outfit that had the hit &quot;Born to Be Alive.&quot; She traveled to Paris with Hernandez; it was there that she met Dan Gilroy, who would soon become her boyfriend. Upon returning to New York, the pair formed the Breakfast Club, a pop/dance group. Madonna originally played drums for the band, but she soon became the lead singer. In 1980, she left the band and formed Emmy with her former boyfriend, drummer Stephen Bray. Soon, Bray and Madonna broke off from the group and began working on some dance/disco-oriented tracks. A demo tape of these tracks worked its way to Mark Kamins, a New York-based DJ/producer. Kamins directed the tape to Sire Records, which signed the singer in 1982.&#xD;&#xA;Kamins produced Madonna&apos;s first single, &quot;Everybody,&quot; which became a club and dance hit at the end of 1982; her second single, 1983&apos;s &quot;Physical Attraction,&quot; was another club hit. In June of 1983, she had her third club hit with the bubbly &quot;Holiday,&quot; which was produced by Jellybean Benitez. Madonna&apos;s self-titled debut album was released in September of 1983; &quot;Holiday&quot; became her first Top 40 hit the following month. &quot;Borderline&quot; became her first Top Ten hit in March of 1984, beginning a remarkable string of 17 consecutive Top Ten hits. While &quot;Lucky Star&quot; was climbing to number four, Madonna began working on her first starring role in a feature film, Susan Seidelman&apos;s Desperately Seeking Susan.&#xD;&#xA;Madonna&apos;s second album, the Nile Rodgers-produced Like a Virgin, was released at the end of 1984. The title track hit number one in December, staying at the top of the charts for six weeks; it was the start of a whirlwind year for the singer. During 1985, Madonna became an international celebrity, selling millions of records on the strength of her stylish, sexy videos and forceful personality. After &quot;Material Girl&quot; became a number two hit in March, Madonna began her first tour, supported by the Beastie Boys. &quot;Crazy for You&quot; became her second number one single in May. Desperately Seeking Susan was released in July, becoming a box office hit; it also prompted a planned video release of A Certain Sacrifice, a low-budget erotic drama she filmed in 1979. A Certain Sacrifice wasn&apos;t the only embarrassing skeleton in the closet dragged into the light during the summer of 1985 -- both Playboy and Penthouse published nude photos of Madonna that she posed for in 1977. Nevertheless, her popularity continued unabated, with thousands of teenage girls adopting her sexy appearance, being dubbed &quot;Madonna wannabes.&quot; In August, she married actor Sean Penn.&#xD;&#xA;Madonna began collaborating with Patrick Leonard at the beginning of 1986; Leonard would co-write most of her biggest hits in the &apos;80s, including &quot;Live to Tell,&quot; which hit number one in June of 1986. A more ambitious and accomplished record than her two previous albums, True Blue was released the following month, to both more massive commercial success (it was a number one in both the U.S. and the U.K., selling over five million copies in America alone) and critical acclaim. &quot;Papa Don&apos;t Preach&quot; became her fourth number one hit in the U.S. While her musical career was thriving, her film career took a savage hit with the November release of Shanghai Surprise. Starring Madonna and Penn, the comedy received terrible reviews, which translated into disastrous box office returns.&#xD;&#xA;At the beginning of 1987, she had her fifth number one single with &quot;Open Your Heart,&quot; the third number one from True Blue alone. The title cut from the soundtrack of her third feature film, Who&apos;s That Girl?, was another chart-topping hit, although the film itself was another box office bomb. 1988 was a relatively quiet year for Madonna as she spent the first half of the year acting in David Mamet&apos;s Speed the Plow on Broadway. In the meantime, she released the remix album You Can Dance. After withdrawing the divorce papers she filed at the beginning of 1988, she divorced Penn at the beginning of 1989.&#xD;&#xA;Like a Prayer, released in the spring of 1989, was her most ambitious and far-reaching album, incorporating elements of pop, rock, and dance. It was another number one hit and launched the number one title track as well as &quot;Express Yourself,&quot; &quot;Cherish,&quot; and &quot;Keep It Together,&quot; three more Top Ten hits. In April 1990, she began her massive Blonde Ambition tour, which ran throughout the entire year. &quot;Vogue&quot; became a number one hit in May, setting the stage for her co-starring role in Warren Beatty&apos;s Dick Tracy; it was her most successful film appearance since Desperately Seeking Susan. Madonna released a greatest-hits album, The Immaculate Collection, at the end of the year. It featured two new songs, including the number one single &quot;Justify My Love,&quot; which sparked another controversy with its sexy video; the second new song, &quot;Rescue Me,&quot; became the highest-debuting single by a female artist in U.S. chart history, entering the charts at number 15. Truth or Dare, a documentary of the Blonde Ambition tour, was released to positive reviews and strong ticket sales during the spring of 1991.&#xD;&#xA;Madonna returned to the charts in the summer of 1992 with the number one &quot;This Used to Be My Playground,&quot; a single featured in the film A League of Their Own, which featured the singer in a small part. Later that year, Madonna released Sex, an expensive, steel-bound soft-core pornographic book that featured hundreds of erotic photographs of herself, several models, and other celebrities -- including Isabella Rossellini, Big Daddy Kane, Naomi Campbell, and Vanilla Ice -- as well as selected prose. Sex received scathing reviews and enormous negative publicity, yet that didn&apos;t stop the accompanying album, Erotica, from selling over two million copies. Bedtime Stories, released two years later, was a more subdued affair than Erotica. Initially, it didn&apos;t chart as impressively, prompting some critics to label her a has-been, yet the album spawned her biggest hit, &quot;Take a Bow,&quot; which spent seven weeks at number one. It also featured the BjÃ¶rk-penned &quot;Bedtime Stories,&quot; which became her first single not to make the Top 40; its follow-up, &quot;Human Nature,&quot; also failed to crack the Top 40. Nevertheless, Bedtime Stories marked her seventh album to go multi-platinum.&#xD;&#xA;Beginning in 1995, Madonna began one of her most subtle image makeovers as she lobbied for the title role in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos;s Evita. Backing away from the overt sexuality of Erotica and Bedtime Stories, Madonna recast herself as an upscale sophisticate, and the compilation Something to Remember fit into the plan nicely. Released in the fall of 1995, around the same time she won the coveted role of Evita Peron, the album was comprised entirely of ballads, designed to appeal to the mature audience that would also be the target of Evita. As the filming completed, Madonna announced she was pregnant and her daughter, Lourdes, was born late in 1996, just as Evita was scheduled for release. The movie was greeted with generally positive reviews and Madonna began a campaign for an Oscar nomination that resulted in her winning the Golden Globe for Best Actress (Musical or Comedy), but not the coveted Academy Award nomination. The soundtrack for Evita, however, was a modest hit, with a dance remix of &quot;Don&apos;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; and the newly written &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; both becoming hits. &#xD;&#xA;During 1997, she worked with producer William Orbit on her first album of new material since 1994&apos;s Bedtime Stories. The resulting release, Ray of Light, was heavily influenced by electronica, techno, and trip-hop, thereby updating her classic dance-pop sound for the late &apos;90s. Ray of Light received uniformly excellent reviews upon its March 1998 release and debuted at number two on the charts. Within a month, the record was shaping up to be her biggest album since Like a Prayer. Two years later she returned with Music, which reunited her with Orbit and also featured production work from Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent and Mirwais, a French electro-pop producer/musician in the vein of Daft Punk and Air. &#xD;&#xA;The year 2000 also saw the birth of Madonna&apos;s second child, Rocco, whom she had with filmmaker Guy Ritchie; the two married at the very end of the year. With Ritchie as director and Madonna as star, the pair released a remake of the film Swept Away in 2002. It tanked at the box office, failing to crack seven digits, making it one of the least profitable films of the year. Her sober 2003 album, American Life, fared slightly better but was hardly a huge success; despite going platinum, it was her lowest-selling album to date. That same year also saw the release of Madonna&apos;s successful children&apos;s book, The English Roses, which was followed by several more novels in future years. &#xD;&#xA;Confessions on a Dance Floor marked her return to music, specifically to the dance-oriented material that had made her a star. Released in late 2005, the album topped the Billboard 200 chart and was accompanied by a world-wide tour in 2006, the same year that I&apos;m Going to Tell You a Secret, a CD/DVD made during her Re-Invention Tour, came out. In 2007, Madonna released another CD/DVD set, The Confessions Tour, this time chronicling her tour of the same name.&#xD;&#xA;She inched closer to the completion of her Warner Bros. contract with 2008&apos;s Hard Candy, featuring collaborations with the Neptunes and Timbaland. As poorly received as it was, the bold album boasted a Top Five hit in &quot;4 Minutes,&quot; and it was supported with the Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour, which concluded in September 2009 (a month prior to her filing for divorce from Ritchie) and produced yet another CD/DVD package, released in 2010. It was her final Warner Bros. release and set the stage for her long-term recording deal with Live Nation.&#xD;&#xA;Madonna began work on her 12th album midway through 2011, with the goal of releasing it early in 2012. The subsequent full-length, MDNA, featured production from French electronic musician and DJ Martin Solveig, as well as longtime collaborator Orbit. The album&apos;s title, an abbreviation of Madonna&apos;s name, appeared on the heels of her performance at the 2012 Super Bowl. Preceded by the Top Ten single &quot;Give Me All Your Luvin&apos;&quot; (featuring Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.), MDNA debuted at number one across the world, including the U.S. and U.K. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61400/thumb/1445625718" art="/library/metadata/61400/art/1445625718" addedAt="1438449855" updatedAt="1445625718">

  <Directory ratingKey="59436" key="/library/metadata/59436/children" type="artist" title="Manic Street Preachers" summary="Dressed in glam clothing, wearing heavy eyeliner, and shouting political rhetoric, the Manic Street Preachers emerged in 1991 from their hometown of Blackwood, Wales, as self-styled &quot;Generation Terrorists.&quot; Fashioning themselves after the Clash and the Sex Pistols, the Manics were on a mission, intending to restore revolution to rock &amp; roll at a time when Britain was dominated by trancey shoegazers and faceless, trippy acid house. Their self-consciously dangerous image, leftist leanings, crunching hard rock, and outsider status made them favorites of the British music press and helped them build a rabidly dedicated following. &#xD;&#xA;For much of the band&apos;s early career, it was impossible to separate the rhetoric from the music and even from the members themselves -- the group&apos;s image was forever associated with lyricist/guitarist Richey James carving the words &quot;4 Real&quot; into his arm during an early interview. As the British pop music climate shifted toward Brit-pop in the wake of Suede, the Manics didn&apos;t achieve fame, but they did have notoriety. Legions of followers emerged, including many bands that formed the core of the short-lived &quot;new wave of new wave&quot; movement. &#xD;&#xA;But as the group climbed toward stardom, the story didn&apos;t get simpler -- it got weirder. James&apos; behavior became increasingly bizarre, culminating on the group&apos;s harrowing 1994 album The Holy Bible. Early in 1995, James disappeared, leaving no trace of his whereabouts. The remaining trio carried on with 1996&apos;s Everything Must Go, the album that established them as superstars in England, yet that came at the expense of the arrogant, renegade gender-bending and revolutionary rhetoric that had earned them their initial fan base. It was a bizarre, unpredictable journey for a group that once proclaimed that all bands should break up after releasing one album. &#xD;&#xA;James Dean Bradfield (vocals, guitar), Nicky Wire (born Nick Jones; bass), Sean Moore (drums), and Flicker (rhythm guitar) formed Betty Blue in 1986. Within two years&apos; time, Flicker had left the band and the group had changed its name to the Manic Street Preachers. In the summer of 1988, a fellow student at Swansea University, Richey James (born Richey Edwards), who had previously been the group&apos;s driver, joined the band as rhythm guitarist. They began recording demos, eventually releasing the single &quot;Suicide Alley&quot; in August. &quot;Suicide Alley&quot; boasted a cover replicating that of the Clash&apos;s first album, which indicated the sound of the group at the time -- equal parts punk and hard rock. A year after the single&apos;s release, NME gave it an enthusiastic review, citing James&apos; press release -- &quot;We are as far away from anything in the &apos;80s as possible.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;Indeed, the Manics were one of the key bands of the early &apos;90s, and their career didn&apos;t get rolling until 1991. The New Art Riot EP appeared in the summer of 1990, followed by a pair of defining singles -- &quot;Motown Junk&quot; and &quot;You Love Us&quot; -- in early 1991 on Heavenly Records. The singles and the Manics&apos; incendiary live shows, where they wrote slogans on their shirts, created a strong buzz in the music press, which only escalated in May. James gave an interview with Steve Lamacq for NME in which Lamacq questioned the group&apos;s authenticity; after an argument, James responded by carving the words &quot;4 Real&quot; on his arm. The incident became a sensation, attracting numerous magazine articles, as well as a major-label contract with Sony. Many observers interpreted the action as a simple stunt, but over the next few years it became clear that the self-mutilation was the first indication of James&apos; mental instability.&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Stay Beautiful&quot; was the Manics&apos; first release for Sony, and it climbed into the British Top 40 late in the summer of 1991, followed early in 1992 by a re-recorded &quot;You Love Us,&quot; which peaked in the Top 20. By the time they released their much-hyped debut album, Generation Terrorists, in February 1992 -- a record the band claimed would outsell Guns N&apos; Roses&apos; Appetite for Destruction -- they had already cultivated a large and devoted following, many of whom emulated their glammy appearance and read the same novels and philosophers the group name-dropped. The Manics had been claiming that they would disband following the release of their debut, yet it became clear by the fall, when a non-LP cover of &quot;Suicide Is Painless (Theme from M*A*S*H)&quot; became their first Top Ten hit, that they would continue performing. Nicky Wire and Richey James had become notorious for their banter throughout the British music press, and while it earned them countless articles, it also painted the group into a corner. Comparatively polished and mainstream compared to its predecessor, Gold Against the Soul, the group&apos;s second album, appeared in the summer of 1993 to mixed reviews.&#xD;&#xA;Shortly after the release of Gold Against the Soul, the Manics&apos; support began to slide as the group began to splinter amidst internal tensions, many of them stemming from James. Nicky Wire ran into trouble over on-stage remarks about R.E.M.&apos;s Michael Stipe dying of AIDS, but Richey James was in genuine trouble. Suffering from deepening alcoholism and anorexia, James entered prolonged bouts of depression, highlighted by incidents of self-mutilation -- most notoriously at a concert in Thailand, when he appeared with his chest slashed open by knives a fan gave him. Early in 1994, he entered a private clinic, and the band had to perform a number of concerts as a trio. James&apos; mental illness surfaced on the group&apos;s third album, The Holy Bible. Reportedly recorded in a red-light district in Wales, The Holy Bible was a bleak, disillusioned record that earned considerable critical acclaim upon its late-summer release in 1994.&#xD;&#xA;Although the Manics&apos; critical reputation was restored and James was playing with the band, even giving numerous interviews with the press, all was not well. Prior to the American release of The Holy Bible and the band&apos;s ensuing tour, James checked out of his London hotel on February 1, 1995, drove to his Cardiff apartment, and disappeared, leaving behind his passport and credit cards. Within the week he was reported missing and his abandoned car was found on the Severen Bridge outside of Bristol, a spot notorious for suicides. By the summer, the police had presumed he was dead. Broken, but not beaten, the remaining Manics decided to carry on as a trio, working the remaining lyrics James left behind into songs.&#xD;&#xA;The Manic Street Preachers returned in December 1995 opening for the Stone Roses. In May 1996, they released Everything Must Go, which was preceded by the number two single &quot;A Design for Life.&quot; Their most direct and mature record to date, Everything Must Go was greeted with enthusiastic reviews, and the Manics became major stars in England. Throughout 1996, the band toured constantly, and most U.K. music publications named Everything Must Go Album of the Year. Despite their growing success, several older fans expressed distress at the group&apos;s increasingly conservative image, yet that didn&apos;t prevent the album from going multi-platinum. &#xD;&#xA;Everything Must Go didn&apos;t just go multi-platinum -- it established the Manics as superstars throughout the world. Everywhere except America, that is. The album received a belated release in the U.S., appearing in August of 1996, and the group attempted an American tour, opening for Oasis. It should have led to increased exposure, but a blowup between the Gallaghers led to Oasis canceling the entire tour, leaving the Manics at square one. They returned to the U.K. and toured, receiving a number of awards at the end of the year. They didn&apos;t deliver their much-anticipated follow-up, This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, until August of 1998. The album was another blockbuster success in the U.K., Europe, and Asia, but it didn&apos;t receive a release in America, since the Manics were in the process of leaving Epic in the U.S. &#xD;&#xA;For a while, there was simply no interest in the Manics by American labels, but another multi-platinum album and numerous awards in Britain revived interest. The band signed with Virgin, which issued This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours in the U.S. during June 1999 -- nearly a year after its initial release. Know Your Enemy followed in 2001, although it was not well received, and the band moved to Sony for British distribution of 2004&apos;s Lifeblood. Both vocalist/guitarist James Dean Bradfield and bassist Nicky Wire followed this release with solo albums, and then reconvened in 2007 to record the edgier, punk-influenced Send Away the Tigers with producer Dave Eringa. After its release, the band quickly set to work on another album, using Richey James&apos; abandoned lyrics as inspiration. &quot;All 13 songs on the new record feature lyrics left to us by Richey,&quot; the Manics wrote on their website in early 2009. &quot;The brilliance and intelligence of the lyrics dictated that we had to finally use them.&quot; Titled Journal for Plague Lovers, the album was recorded on analog tape by veteran engineer Steve Albini and released that May. Postcards from a Young Man, the band&apos;s tenth studio album, followed in 2010. &#xD;&#xA;After releasing a compilation called National Treasures: The Complete Singles in the fall of 2011, the Manics released a super-deluxe 20th Anniversary edition of Generation Terrorists in 2012. Meanwhile, the band plugged away in the studio, working on a ludicrously ambitious project tentatively titled 70 Songs of Hatred and Failure. At one point they despaired of simply having written too much material, before hitting on the idea of releasing two very different albums. The first, a folky, almost entirely acoustic, emotionally raw effort entitled Rewind the Film, appeared in the fall of 2013, and the second, the &quot;spiky&quot; and Krautrock-inspired Futurology, was slated for May 2014. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59436/thumb/1445624878" art="/library/metadata/59436/art/1445624878" addedAt="1438446903" updatedAt="1445624878">

  <Directory ratingKey="61368" key="/library/metadata/61368/children" type="artist" title="Maroon 5" summary="A mix of polished pop/rock and neo-soul made Maroon 5 one of the most popular bands of the 2000s, with songs like &quot;This Love,&quot; &quot;She Will Be Loved,&quot; and &quot;Makes Me Wonder&quot; all topping the charts worldwide. Previously, bandmates Adam Levine (vocals/guitar), Jesse Carmichael (keyboards), Mickey Madden (bass), and Ryan Dusick (drums) had spent the latter half of the &apos;90s playing in Kara&apos;s Flowers, even releasing a debut album for Reprise Records while still attending high school. The record tanked, however, and Kara&apos;s Flowers found themselves dropped from Reprise&apos;s roster. After briefly attending college, the bandmates regrouped as Maroon 5, adding former Square guitarist James Valentine to the lineup and embracing a more R&amp;B-influenced sound. Several years later, the quintet had officially risen to the forefront of pop music with Songs About Jane and It Won&apos;t Be Soon Before Long, both of which went multi-platinum. &#xD;&#xA;Songs About Jane propelled the band into the mainstream, but the album was not an immediate hit. Octone Records had signed the newly christened Maroon 5 in 2001, and the debut album Jane received a lukewarm response upon its release in June 2002. &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; became a radio staple 17 months later and was soon followed by the omnipresent &quot;This Love,&quot; whose steamy video (featuring frontman Levine and a barely clothed girlfriend) wooed the TV-watching crowds at MTV. Songs About Jane finally entered the Billboard Top Ten in August 2004, more than two years after the album&apos;s release, and follow-up singles like &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; helped the album move over 2.7 million copies by year&apos;s end. &#xD;&#xA;Maroon 5 toured exhaustively in support of Jane&apos;s slow-burning success, issuing two stopgap recordings -- 2004&apos;s 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005&apos;s Live Friday the 13th -- while traveling the world alongside groups like the Rolling Stones and John Mayer. Their schedule was especially trying on percussionist Dusick, who sustained wrist and shoulder injuries and was often unable to play. By fall 2006, Dusick had been officially replaced by Matt Flynn (the former drummer for Gavin DeGraw), and the revised band released its sophomore effort in May 2007. It Won&apos;t Be Soon Before Long proved to be less popular than its predecessor (which had sold more than four million copies in the U.S. alone), but it still enjoyed double-platinum certification while spinning off the chart-topping single &quot;Makes Me Wonder.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;Maroon 5 had cemented their status as pop/rock heavyweights, and they now had the connections to prove it. Released in late 2008, Call and Response: The Remix Album reinterpreted the band&apos;s catalog with remixes by influential producers like Mary J. Blige, Mark Ronson, and Pharrell Williams. Meanwhile, the band worked with a different producer -- veteran rock/country architect Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange -- on a third studio album, Hands All Over, which was released in September 2010. The following year, Levine appeared as a judge on the NBC reality television talent competition The Voice. That same year, Hands All Over was re-released with the single &quot;Moves Like Jagger,&quot; featuring Levine&apos;s The Voice co-judge Christina Aguilera. In 2012, Carmichael revealed that he was taking time off from performing with Maroon 5 and would be replaced by touring keyboardist PJ Morton. Also in 2012, the band released its fourth studio album, Overexposed. Featuring production from a bevy of name producers including Ryan Tedder, Max Martin, Benny Blanco, and more, the album included the leadoff single &quot;Payphone.&quot; ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61368/thumb/1445625667" art="/library/metadata/61368/art/1445625667" addedAt="1438456228" updatedAt="1445625667">

  <Directory ratingKey="64674" key="/library/metadata/64674/children" type="artist" title="Mazzy Star" summary="If psychedelic music had a voice in &apos;90s post-punk, Mazzy Star may have been its strongest reincarnation. That doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that fans of the Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead will find the band to their liking, however. Mazzy Star much preferred the dark side of psychedelia, as exemplified by the most distended tracks of the Doors and the Velvet Underground. Their fuzzy guitar workouts and plaintive folky compositions are often suffused in a dissociative ennui that is very much of the &apos;90s, however much their textures may recall the drug-induced states of vintage psychedelia.&#xD;&#xA;Although Mazzy Star was nominally a full band, they were basically the core duo of guitarist David Roback and singer Hope Sandoval with backing musicians. Roback boasts a long history in the paisley underground, with the Rain Parade and Opal. He came across Sandoval after hearing a tape she had made as part of a folky duo, Going Home. (The Going Home album that Roback subsequently produced remains unissued.) Sandoval ended up replacing Kendra Smith on Opal&apos;s final tours. After Opal dissolved, Roback and Sandoval continued to work together as Mazzy Star, and released their first album for Rough Trade, She Hangs Brightly, in 1990.&#xD;&#xA;Rough Trade&apos;s U.S. branch went under shortly afterwards, but luckily Mazzy Star were picked up by Capitol, who kept the debut in print and issued their follow-up, 1993&apos;s So Tonight That I Might See. There isn&apos;t much to differentiate the two albums, though that&apos;s not necessarily a criticism. Both share similar strengths and weaknesses: appealingly dreamy and atmospheric arrangements, rambling distorted guitar workouts, and lyrics that mix the haunting and the meaninglessly vague. Tonight That I Might See had been around for about a year before it suddenly got hot, reaching the Top 40, and spinning off a small hit single, &quot;Fade Into You.&quot; Even in the wake of this surprise success, Roback and Sandoval remained as enigmatic and aloof as their music, rarely submitting to interviews, and offering mysterious, unhelpful replies when journalists did manage to talk with them. &#xD;&#xA;In 1996 they released their third album, Among My Swan, which presented a far more acoustic approach from Sandoval and Roback. They shunned the echoed, shoegaze-influenced guitars that featured heavily on much of their first two records and opted for a pared-down acoustic affair. The record also proved to be their last with major-label Capitol, and they parted ways. A year later the band went on hiatus and started work on alternative projects. Roback worked with Beth Orton on her album Central Reservation; while Sandoval appeared on the Jesus and Mary Chain&apos;s 1998 record Munki and went on to create Hope Sandoval &amp; the Warm Inventions with My Bloody Valentine drummer Colm O&apos;Ciosoig. They returned briefly in 2000 for a mini-tour of Europe and in 2003 the duo performed together as part of Bert Jansch&apos;s 60th birthday celebrations in London. &#xD;&#xA;A flurry of activity in the late 2000s saw their song &quot;Into Dust&quot; used on an advert for Virgin Media and then on a trailer for popular video game Gears of War 3, which propelled the song into the U.K. singles chart. This was shortly followed by the confirmation that Sandoval and Roback had been working on new material for a fourth album, and they released their first new material in 15 years when double-A-side single &quot;Common Burn/Lay Myself Down&quot; arrived in 2011. This was swiftly followed by a North American and European tour in 2012. The following year, details were announced for their fourth full-length record, titled Seasons of Your Day, which was expected in 2013. ~ Richie Unterberger &amp; Scott Kerr" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64674/thumb/1445627425" art="/library/metadata/64674/art/1445627425" addedAt="1438447396" updatedAt="1445627425">

  <Directory ratingKey="59378" key="/library/metadata/59378/children" type="artist" title="Mercury Rev" summary="Not so much a band as a long, strange trip, the chaotic avant pop pranksters Mercury Rev formed in Buffalo, NY, in the late &apos;80s. Originally comprised of vocalist David Baker, vocalist/silver pickup guitarist Jonathan Donahue, guitar shaper/single-exhaust clarinetist Grasshopper (born Sean Mackowiak), rooster-tail bass flutist Suzanne Thorpe, bass explorer Dave Fridmann, and mojo stick drummer Jimy Chambers, the sextet -- always rife with personality conflicts -- interacted with one another infrequently, and their first recordings evolved simply as a means of creating soundtracks for the members&apos; experimental student films as well as for Howard Nelson&apos;s Lite-Brite and Marco Fogg&apos;s Sugardaddy Sea.&#xD;&#xA;Encouraged to further their music by academic mentor Tony Conrad -- a minimalist composer and multimedia artist who had performed with John Cale, La Monte Young, and Faust -- the loosely connected aggregate dubbed Mercury Rev (a name whose inspiration was variously attributed to an imaginary Russian ballet dancer, a sharp rise in temperature, or a revved-up auto) began to emerge, and eventually the group recorded a demo onto a reel of 35mm magnetic film. At the same time, Donahue was working as a concert promoter and scheduled a Butthole Surfers gig; after the show, he befriended the support act, Oklahoma&apos;s likeminded Flaming Lips, and soon joined the tour as a guitar technician. Ultimately, Donahue -- under the alias &quot;Dingus&quot; -- became the Lips&apos; lead guitarist, and with them recorded 1990&apos;s In a Priest Driven Ambulance, an album produced by Fridmann.&#xD;&#xA;With Mercury Rev effectively in limbo and its members scattered across the country, their demo tape somehow made its way to the British offices of the Rough Trade label, which contacted Baker about signing the group. Soon, the band convened to record their debut, Yerself Is Steam, an LP cut at the same time Donahue and Fridmann were also working on the Flaming Lips&apos; major-label bow, Hit to Death in the Future Head. A brilliantly melodic and free-form set highlighted by distorted art pop epics like &quot;Chasing a Bee,&quot; &quot;Coney Island Cyclone,&quot; and &quot;Frittering,&quot; Yerself Is Steam was issued to widespread acclaim in 1991; however, within weeks of the LP&apos;s release Rough Trade&apos;s American branch declared bankruptcy, aborting any hopes of proper distribution or promotion. &#xD;&#xA;Still, a British tour followed, and not without incident; the performances, mounted without any practice sessions, constantly teetered on the brink of disintegration -- set lists were nonexistent, and Baker frequently hopped off the stage (in midsong, no less) to grab a drink. Additionally, the group was reportedly banned from air travel after Donahue attempted to gouge out Grasshopper&apos;s eye with a spoon in mid-flight. Following the tour, Mercury Rev again went their separate ways; the members found menial jobs, moved in with their parents, or earned money by participating in medical experiments. Finally, Sony signed the group and reissued Yerself Is Steam along with an extra track, the sublime single &quot;Car Wash Hair&quot; (recorded with the aid of Luna&apos;s Dean Wareham after Fridmann -- much to his bandmates&apos; dismay -- spent all of their advance money to fund a Bermuda vacation package for his mother). &#xD;&#xA;Amid considerable tension, Mercury Rev set up studio space in a barn to craft their second album; after completing the principal recording sessions, the group collected samples from sites as far-ranging as Times Square and NASA&apos;s Cape Canaveral to flesh out the music&apos;s dense, prismatic sound. Following the release of the stunning 1993 LP, dubbed Boces in honor of an upstate New York school for children, Mercury Rev again toured, even playing the second stage at Lollapalooza; ultimately, the band was kicked off the bill during the festival&apos;s Denver stop due to excessive noise -- the electricity to the stage was cut off in mid-performance, and concert security removed their soundman in a headlock. Additionally, an elaborate video for the single &quot;Something for Joey&quot; was shot with the notorious porn star Ron Jeremy, but the clip&apos;s suggestive space-age sexcapades and visual double-entendres made mainstream airplay a moot point.&#xD;&#xA;After relations soured to the point where Baker was traveling to gigs apart from his bandmates, he was dismissed from Mercury Rev&apos;s ranks; under the name Shady, he returned in 1994 with World, an excellent solo LP recorded with luminaries from the Boo Radleys, Rollerskate Skinny, and St. Johnny. With their newly perfected Tettix Wave Accumulator (patent pending) in tow, the remaining quintet returned to the studio to record 1995&apos;s See You on the Other Side, a beautiful, shimmering effort that found the group -- newly freed of Baker&apos;s darker impulses -- exploring increasingly diverse stylistic territory with newfound emotional depth. Under the name Harmony Rockets, Mercury Rev also issued 1995&apos;s Paralyzed Mind of the Archangel Void, a 40-minute improvisational excursion into ambient noise. &#xD;&#xA;The lovely Deserter&apos;s Songs followed in the fall of 1998, and the album&apos;s appearance on dozens of best-of lists sparked a renaissance of sorts for Mercury Rev, especially in England. For their next album, the band was slated to work with Jack Nitzsche -- famous for his arrangements on many classics of the Phil Spector canon -- until Nitzsche passed away a week before recording began. Expanding on the dramatic blueprint of Deserter&apos;s Songs (in a way Nitzsche would surely have been proud of), Mercury Rev released All Is Dream on September 11, 2001. Secret Migration arrived in 2005; reflecting the band&apos;s popularity in the U.K., it was released there that winter and in the U.S. that spring. Late 2006/early 2007 was a busy time for the band, with the best-of Essential: Stillness Breathes 1991-2006, the soundtrack Hello Blackbird, and the mix album Back to Mine all arriving at that time. For 2008&apos;s delicate, largely electronic Snowflake Midnight, Mercury Rev moved to Yep Rock; they also released a companion album, Strange Attractor, as a free online download. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59378/thumb/1445624839" art="/library/metadata/59378/art/1445624839" addedAt="1438448021" updatedAt="1445624839">

  <Directory ratingKey="59355" key="/library/metadata/59355/children" type="artist" title="Metallica" summary="Metallica were easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the &apos;80s. Responsible for bringing the genre back to Earth, the bandmates looked and talked like they were from the street, shunning the usual rock star games of metal musicians during the early &apos;80s. Metallica also expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions. The release of 1983&apos;s Kill &apos;Em All marked the beginning of the legitimization of heavy metal&apos;s underground, bringing new complexity and depth to thrash metal. With each album, the band&apos;s playing and writing improved; James Hetfield developed a signature rhythm playing that matched his growl, while lead guitarist Kirk Hammett became one of the most copied guitarists in metal. To complete the package, Lars Ulrich&apos;s thunderous (yet complex) drumming clicked in perfectly with Cliff Burton&apos;s innovative bass playing. &#xD;&#xA;After releasing their masterpiece Master of Puppets in 1986, tragedy struck the band when their tour bus crashed while traveling in Sweden. Burton died in the accident. When the band decided to continue, Jason Newsted was chosen to replace Burton; two years later, the band released the conceptually ambitious ...And Justice for All, which hit the Top Ten without any radio play and very little support from MTV. But Metallica completely crossed over into the mainstream with 1991&apos;s Metallica, a self-titled effort that found the band trading in its long compositions for more concise song structures. Peppered with hits like &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; and &quot;Enter Sandman,&quot; it resulted in a number one album that sold over seven million copies in the U.S. alone. To support the record, Metallica launched a long tour that kept the musicians on the road for nearly two years. &#xD;&#xA;By the &apos;90s, Metallica had changed the rules for all heavy metal bands; they were the leaders of the genre, respected not only by headbangers, but by mainstream record buyers and critics. No other heavy metal band has ever been able to pull off such a feat. However, the group lost a portion of its core audience with its long-awaited follow-up to Metallica, 1996&apos;s Load. The album moved the band toward alternative rock in terms of image -- the bandmembers cut their hair and had their picture taken by Anton Corbijn. Although the album was a hit upon its summer release, entering the charts at number one and selling three million copies within two months, certain members of the Metallica fan base complained about the shift in image, as well as the group&apos;s decision to headline the sixth Lollapalooza. Re-Load, which combined new material with songs left off the original Load record, appeared in 1997; despite poor reviews, it sold at a typically brisk pace and spun off several successful singles, including &quot;Fuel&quot; and &quot;The Memory Remains.&quot; Garage Inc., a double-disc collection of B-sides, rarities, and newly recorded covers, followed in 1998. Metallica&apos;s take on Bob Seger&apos;s &quot;Turn the Page&quot; helped maintain their presence in the charts, and the band continued its flood of product with 1999&apos;s S&amp;M, which documented a live concert with the San Francisco Symphony. It debuted at number two, reconfirming the group&apos;s immense popularity.&#xD;&#xA;Metallica spent most of 2000 embroiled in controversy by spearheading a legal assault against Napster, a file-sharing service that allowed users to download music files from each other&apos;s computers. Aggressively targeting copyright infringement of their own material, Metallica notoriously had over 300,000 users kicked off the service, creating a widespread debate over the availability of digital music that raged for most of the year. In January 2001, bassist Jason Newsted announced his amicable departure from the band. Shortly after the band appeared at the ESPN Awards in April of the same year, Hetfield, Hammett, and Ulrich entered the recording studio to begin work on their next album, with producer Bob Rock lined up to handle bass duties for the sessions (meanwhile, rumors swirled of former Ozzy Osbourne/Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez being considered for the vacated position). In July, Metallica surprisingly dropped their lawsuit against Napster, perhaps sensing that their controversial stance did more harm than good to their &quot;band of the people&quot; image. That same summer, the band&apos;s recording sessions (and all other band-related matters) were put on hold as Hetfield entered an undisclosed rehab facility for alcoholism and other addictions. He completed treatment and rejoined Metallica as they headed back into the studio in 2002 to record St. Anger, which was released in mid-2003.&#xD;&#xA;The recording of St. Anger was capped with the search for a permanent replacement for Newsted. After a long audition process, former Ozzy Osbourne/Suicidal Tendencies bass player Robert Trujillo was selected and joined Metallica for their 2003-2004 world tour. The growing pains that the band experienced during the recording of St. Anger were captured in the celebrated documentary Some Kind of Monster, which saw theatrical release in 2004. Four years later, the band returned with Death Magnetic, an energized album that returned the band to its early-&apos;80s roots. Former Slayer producer Rick Rubin helmed the album, having replaced the band&apos;s longtime producer Bob Rock, while Kirk Hammett (who was forbidden to play guitar solos on St. Anger) peppered the record with metallic riffs and frenetic solos. &#xD;&#xA;Death Magnetic spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard charts and the group supported it with an extensive international tour that included a festival gig with Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Metallica closed out their Warner contract with Death Magnetic -- outtakes from the sessions appeared as the Beyond Magnetic EP in late 2011 -- and while they were exploring their options, they struck up a collaboration with Lou Reed, releasing the ambitious, arty Lulu in the fall of 2011. In 2012 Metallica launched their own label, Blackened, which would be distributed by Universal; then, the following year, they announced the release of their second motion picture, Through the Never, which combined spectacular concert footage of them blasting through gems from their back catalog with a surreal road-trip odyssey starring Dane DeHaan. The film and its accompanying soundtrack album were released in September 2013. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Greg Prato" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59355/thumb/1445624888" art="/library/metadata/59355/art/1445624888" addedAt="1438447442" updatedAt="1445624888">

Raised in Arizona, Branch sang throughout her childhood but didnât pick up the guitar until her 14th birthday, when she received the instrument as a gift. Within a week, sheâd written her first song. Branchâs parents eventually decided to home school their daughter, allowing her more time to focus on a budding musical career and play shows in the Sedona area. Following the release of her first independent album, 1998âs Broken Bracelet, Branch began attracting attention from major labels.&#xD;&#xA;She signed with Maverick Records and began co-writing with John Shanks, a former member of Melissa Etheridgeâs band who had since moved into production. Together, the two wrote âEverywhere,â which became Branchâs first hit single in 2001. Released that summer, her debut album quickly produced two more hits, including the Top Ten single âAll You Wanted.â While working on a second album, Branch found time to collaborate with Santana on âThe Game of Love,â which became the lead single for Santanaâs 2002 album Shaman. âThe Game of Loveâ peaked at number five and eventually won a Grammy Award, while âAre You Happy Now?â -- the first song from Branchâs sophomore album, Hotel Paper -- maintained her presence on the charts in early 2003. &#xD;&#xA;Like The Spirit Room, Hotel Paper went platinum and spawned two Top 40 singles. While touring in support of the album, Branch became engaged to her bass player, Teddy Landau, and the two married in May 2004. One year later, she launched a country side project with her backup singer, Jessica Harp. Initially calling themselves the Cass County Homewreckers, the two eventually trimmed down their name to the Wreckers and released an album, Stand Still, Look Pretty, in 2006. The album went gold, due in large part to the lead single âLeave the Pieces,â which topped the country charts. &#xD;&#xA;The Wreckers went their separate ways in 2007, with both musicians returning to their own careers. Branch spent several years writing songs and making guest appearances on other albums (including Chris Isaakâs Mr. Lucky) before issuing a short EP, Everything Comes and Goes, in 2010. Meanwhile, she readied a full album, Different Kind of Country, for release later that year. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59342/thumb/1445624848" art="/library/metadata/59342/art/1445624848" addedAt="1438457961" updatedAt="1445624848">

  <Directory ratingKey="59273" key="/library/metadata/59273/children" type="artist" title="Moby" summary="Moby was one of the most controversial figures in techno music, alternately praised for bringing a face to the notoriously anonymous electronic genre and scorned by hordes of techno artists and fans for diluting and trivializing the form. In either case, Moby was one of the most important dance music figures of the early &apos;90s, helping bring the music to a mainstream audience both in England and in America. Moby fused rapid disco beats with heavy distorted guitars, punk rhythms, and detailed productions that drew equally from pop, dance, and movie soundtracks. Not only did his music differ from both the cool surface textures of ambient music and the hedonistic world of house music, but so did his lifestyle; Moby was famous for his devout radical Christian beliefs, as well as his environmental and vegan activism. &quot;Go&quot; became a British Top Ten hit in 1991, establishing him as one of the premier techno producers. By the time he came to the attention of American record critics with 1995&apos;s Everything Is Wrong, his following from the early &apos;90s had begun to erode, particularly in Britain. Nevertheless, he remained one of the most recognizable figures within techno; after he abandoned the music for guitar rock with 1996&apos;s Animal Rights, he returned to a heavy electronic base with 1997&apos;s I Like to Score and 1999&apos;s Play, the latter of which made him a genuine breakout pop star.&#xD;&#xA;Born Richard Melville Hall, Moby received his nickname as a child; it derives from the fact that Herman Melville, the author of Moby Dick, is his great-great grand uncle. Moby was raised in Darien, Connecticut, where he played in a hardcore punk band called the Vatican Commandos as a teenager. Later, he briefly sang with Flipper while their singer was serving time in jail. He briefly attended college before he moved to New York City, where he began DJing in dance clubs. During the late &apos;80s and 1990, he released a number of singles and EPs for the independent label Instinct. In 1991, he set the theme from David Lynch&apos;s television series Twin Peaks to an insistent house-derived rhythm and titled the result &quot;Go.&quot; The single became a surprise British hit single, climbing into the Top Ten. Following its success, Moby was invited to remix a number of mainstream and underground acts, including Michael Jackson, Pet Shop Boys, Brian Eno, Depeche Mode, Erasure, the B-52&apos;s, and Orbital.&#xD;&#xA;Moby continued performing at dances and raves throughout 1991 and 1992, culminating in a set at 1992&apos;s Mixmag awards, where he broke his keyboards at the end of his concert. Moby, his first full-length album, appeared in 1992. In 1993, he released the double A-sided single &quot;I Feel It&quot;/&quot;Thousand,&quot; which became a moderate U.K. hit. According to The Guinness Book of Records, &quot;Thousand&quot; is the fastest single ever, appropriately clocking in at 1,000 beats a minute. That same year, Moby signed a record contract with Mute and his first release was Ambient, which compiled unissued material recorded between 1988 and 1991. Later that year, The Story So Far, a collection of singles released on Instinct, appeared. In 1994, the single &quot;Hymn&quot; -- one of the first fusions of gospel, techno, and ambient music -- was released.&#xD;&#xA;In 1994, Moby signed a major-label contract with Elektra in the U.S. Everything Is Wrong, his first album released under the deal, appeared in the spring of 1995 to uniformly positive reviews, especially in the American press, which had previously ignored him. Despite the promotional push behind the album and his popular sets at the 1995 Lollapalooza festival, the album wasn&apos;t a commercial success. &quot;Bring Back My Happiness,&quot; however, was a Top Ten hit on Billboard&apos;s club chart. The following year, Moby incorporated heavy guitar rock for 1996&apos;s Animal Rights, which featured a cover of Mission of Burma&apos;s &quot;That&apos;s When I Reach for My Revolver&quot; and received mixed reviews. One year later, Elektra collected his soundtrack highlights for I Like to Score, a compilation that included his remix of &quot;The James Bond Theme&quot; for Tomorrow Never Dies, as well as contributions to Cool World, Heat, and Scream.&#xD;&#xA;Moby&apos;s fifth studio album, Play, appeared in 1999. Surpassing everyone&apos;s expectations, the album -- featuring numerous samples of Alan Lomax field recordings -- went double platinum in the U.S. and reached number one in the U.K. Aside from its hit singles, Play&apos;s success was assured when its tracks were licensed by dozens of advertisers and compilers. Always a restless producer, Moby followed Play with 18 (2002), a relatively reflective and restrained set dotted with an eclectic list of guest vocalists (including MC Lyte, Angie Stone, and SinÃ©ad O&apos;Connor). It debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 but didn&apos;t come close to catching Play in terms of sales.&#xD;&#xA;The downward trend in mainstream appeal continued with Hotel (2005), a mixture of basic contemporary rock and downbeat electronica; early copies were bundled with an ambient disc worthy of separate release. On Last Night, seemingly unaware of contemporary trends in dance music, Moby made a return to club hedonism with some of his most creative -- if unapologetically nostalgic -- material. The austere and morose Wait for Me (2009), featuring a show-stealing appearance from soul singer Leela James, was just the opposite in tone. Destroyed (2011), recorded during late-night sessions in hotel rooms, offered a natural extension of Wait for Me&apos;s alienated feel. The companion piece Destroyed Remixed (2012) followed shortly thereafter; a limited double-disc compilation, it featured exclusive remixes by David Lynch, Holy Ghost!, and System Divine, as well as a previously unreleased 30-minute ambient piece by Moby himself.&#xD;&#xA;After several appearances in early 2013, including DJ sets at the Coachella festival, Moby released a special 7&quot; for Record Store Day, entitled &quot;The Lonely Night,&quot; which featured vocals from Mark Lanegan. The song was included on Innocents, an album mixed by Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent, released that October. Other guest vocalists included Damien Jurado, the Flaming Lips&apos; Wayne Coyne, and Skylar Grey. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Andy Kellman" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59273/thumb/1445624817" art="/library/metadata/59273/art/1445624817" addedAt="1438447450" updatedAt="1445624817">

Bored by the sleepy life provided by their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon, the three British friends began playing music together. They started the first incarnation of their band while only 13 years old, changing the name of the group from Gothic Plague to Fixed Penalty to Rocket Baby Dolls as time passed. By 1997, the bandmates settled on the name Muse and released their self-titled debut EP on Dangerous Records, followed by the Muscle Museum EP in 1998. The group&apos;s emotive, passionate sound and live presence drew critical acclaim and industry buzz, and Muse signed a deal with Maverick Records after a trip to New York&apos;s CMJ festival. The singles &quot;Cave&quot; and &quot;Uno&quot; preceded their debut full-length album, Showbiz, which was released toward the end of 1999. Two years later, Muse issued The Origin of Symmetry and had a major hit with &quot;Hyper Music,&quot; which helped propel the album to platinum status in the U.K. &#xD;&#xA;In 2002, fans were treated to Hullabaloo Soundtrack, a combination rarities/live set that peaked at number ten in Europe. Muse then returned with a proper studio effort, Absolution, which became the band&apos;s first album to chart in America. A short North American tour in the spring of 2004 coincided with Muse&apos;s spot on the fifth annual Coachella Music and Arts Festival, and Absolution eventually went gold in the U.S. Back at home, the album earned Muse their second platinum certification. Released two years later, Black Holes and Revelations marked the band&apos;s brightest, most dynamic set of material to date, topping the U.K. album chart within its first week and earning Muse their second consecutive number one album at home. In America, Black Holes and Revelations broke into the Top Ten. &#xD;&#xA;Muse toured Europe, America, Australia, and Southeast Asia in support of the album, and their dynamic stage performance (which won the band multiple awards for Best Live Act, including accolades from the NME Awards, the Q Awards, and the Vodafone Live Music Awards) was captured on 2008&apos;s H.A.A.R.P. Live from Wembley. The trio spent the remainder of that year -- as well as the early part of 2009 -- in the recording studio, eventually emerging with the release of The Resistance in September. The band kicked off a world tour, headlining shows as well as supporting U2. In 2011 Bellamy and company were asked to write the official theme for the 2012 Summer Olympics, which were being held in London, and the band returned with the triumphant rock anthem &quot;Survival,&quot; which would also become the lead single of their next album, 2012&apos;s The 2nd Law. The road-hungry band undertook another large-scale tour to promote the album, and their spectacular show at Rome&apos;s Olympic Stadium -- complete with pyrotechnics, video walls, and acrobats -- was filmed in ultra-high definition for the concert movie Live at Rome Olympic Stadium, which was slated for release theatrically and on DVD in December 2013. ~ Heather Phares" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59246/thumb/1445624807" art="/library/metadata/59246/art/1445624807" addedAt="1438454096" updatedAt="1445624807">

Before this side project took shape, Hugo and Williams -- as the Neptunes -- had established themselves as giants in the field of pop production, whether they were working with hardcore rappers, smooth crooners, or teen pop groups. Although their faces were known to many due to this prominence, N.E.R.D. allowed the duo to take center stage, as rock stars, even if a new alias was being used. &#xD;&#xA;The trio recorded its first album, In Search Of..., and released it in Europe in late 2001. Not entirely happy with the results, they reshaped the album using live instrumentation -- with significant assistance from the funk-rock band Spymob, to further differentiate the material from Neptunes productions -- before issuing it in the U.S. in March 2002. Singles &quot;Lapdance&quot; and &quot;Rock Star&quot; made minor indentations on the singles charts; despite this, the album didn&apos;t come close to achieving the kind of commercial success won by the average Neptunes production. In March 2004, after another endless influx of hitmaking Neptunes work, they resurfaced with Fly or Die. This time out, Hugo and Williams handled more of the instrumentation. Unrelenting in their knack for the absurd, lead single &quot;She Wants to Move&quot; was promoted with a video that depicted the three members performing in the rear &quot;compartment&quot; of a female-shaped space vessel -- a very literal interpretation of the line &quot;Her ass is a spaceship I want to ride.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;The trio&apos;s third album, Seeing Sounds, followed in June 2008. Unlike In Search Of... and Fly or Die, the disc failed to reach gold-selling status in the U.S., even though it had a strong first week and reached the Top 10 of the Billboard 200. The group eventually welcomed Rhea into the fold and performed as quartet, but the vocalist was let go several months prior to the release of September 2010&apos;s Nothing.

  <Directory ratingKey="59235" key="/library/metadata/59235/children" type="artist" title="Neil Young" summary="After Neil Young left the California folk-rock band Buffalo Springfield in 1968, he slowly established himself as one of the most influential and idiosyncratic singer/songwriters of his generation. Young&apos;s body of work ranks second only to Bob Dylan in terms of depth, and he was able to sustain his critical reputation, as well as record sales, for a longer period of time than Dylan, partially because of his willfully perverse work ethic. From the beginning of his solo career in the late &apos;60s through to the 21st century, he never stopped writing, recording, and performing; his official catalog only represented a portion of his work, since he kept countless tapes of unreleased songs in his vaults. &#xD;&#xA;Just as importantly, Young continually explored new musical territory, from rockabilly and the blues to electronic music. But these stylistic exercises only gained depth when compared to his two primary styles: gentle folk and country-rock, and crushingly loud electric guitar rock, which he frequently recorded with the Californian garage band Crazy Horse. Throughout his career, Young alternated between these two extremes, and both proved equally influential; there were just as many singer/songwriters as there were grunge and country-rock bands claiming to be influenced by Neil Young. Despite his enormous catalog and influence, Young continued to move forward, writing new songs and exploring new music. That restless spirit ensured that he was one of the few rock veterans as vital in his old age as he was in his youth. &#xD;&#xA;Born in Toronto, Canada, Neil Young moved to Winnipeg with his mother following her divorce from his sports journalist father. Young began playing music in high school. Not only did he play in garage rock outfits like the Squires, but he also played in local folk clubs and coffeehouses, where he eventually met Joni Mitchell and Stephen Stills. During the mid-&apos;60s, he returned to Toronto, where he played as a solo folk act. By 1966, he joined the Mynah Birds, which also featured bassist Bruce Palmer and Rick James. The group recorded an album&apos;s worth of material for Motown, none of which was released at the time. Frustrated by his lack of success, Young moved to Los Angeles in his Pontiac hearse, taking Palmer along as support. Shortly after they arrived in L.A., they happened to meet Stills, and they formed Buffalo Springfield, who quickly became one of the leaders of the Californian folk-rock scene. &#xD;&#xA;Despite the success of Buffalo Springfield, the group was plagued with tension, and Young quit the band several times before finally leaving to become a solo artist in May of 1968. Hiring Elliot Roberts as his manager, Young signed with Reprise Records and released his eponymous debut album in early 1969. By the time the album was released, he had begun playing with a local band called the Rockets, which featured guitarist Danny Whitten, bassist Billy Talbot, and drummer Ralph Molina. Young renamed the group Crazy Horse and had them support him on his second album, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, which was recorded in just two weeks. Featuring such Young staples as &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; and &quot;Down by the River,&quot; the album went gold. Following the completion of the record, he began jamming with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, eventually joining the group for their spring 1970 album, DÃ©jÃ  Vu. Although he was now part of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Young continued to record as a solo artist, releasing After the Gold Rush in August 1970. After the Gold Rush, with its accompanying single &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart,&quot; established Young as a solo star, and fame only increased through his association with CSN&amp;Y. &#xD;&#xA;Although Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young were a very successful act, they were also volatile, and they had split by the spring 1971 release of the live Four Way Street. The following year, Young had his first number one album with the mellow country-rock of Harvest, which also featured his first (and only) number one single, &quot;Heart of Gold.&quot; Instead of embracing his success, he spurned it, following it with the noisy, bleak live film Journey Through the Past. Both the movie and its soundtrack received terrible reviews, as did the live Time Fades Away, an album recorded with the Stray Gators that was released in 1973. &#xD;&#xA;Both Journey Through the Past and Time Fades Away signaled that Young was entering a dark period in his life, but they only scratched the surface of his anguish. Inspired by the overdose deaths of Danny Whitten in 1972 and his roadie Bruce Berry the following year, Young wrote and recorded the bleak, druggy Tonight&apos;s the Night late in 1973, but declined to release it at the time. Instead, he released On the Beach, which was nearly as harrowing, in 1974; Tonight&apos;s the Night finally appeared in the spring of 1975. By the time of its release, Young had recovered, as indicated by the record&apos;s hard-rocking follow-up, Zuma, an album recorded with Crazy Horse and released later that year. &#xD;&#xA;Young&apos;s focus began to wander in 1976, as he recorded the duet album Long May You Run with Stephen Stills and then abandoned his partner midway through the supporting tour. The following year he recorded the country-rock-oriented American Stars &apos;n Bars, which featured vocals by Nicolette Larson, who was also prominent on 1978&apos;s Comes a Time. Prior to the release of Comes a Time, Young scrapped the country-rock album Homegrown and assembled the triple-album retrospective Decade. At the end of 1978, he embarked on an arena tour called Rust Never Sleeps, which was designed as a showcase for new songs. Half of the concert featured Young solo, the other half featured him with Crazy Horse. That was the pattern that Rust Never Sleeps, released in the summer of 1979, followed. The record was hailed as a comeback, proving that Young was one of the few rock veterans who attacked punk rock head-on. That fall he released the double album Live Rust and the live movie Rust Never Sleeps. &#xD;&#xA;Rust Never Sleeps restored Young to his past glory, but he perversely decided to trash his goodwill in 1980 with Hawks &amp; Doves, a collection of acoustic songs that bore the influence of conservative, right-wing politics. In 1981, Young released the heavy rock album Re*ac*tor, which received poor reviews. Following its release, he left Reprise for the fledgling Geffen Records, where he was promised lots of money and artistic freedom. Young decided to push his Geffen contract to the limit, releasing the electronic Trans in December 1982, where his voice was recorded through a computerized vocoder. The album and its accompanying technology-dependent tour were received with bewildered, negative reviews. The rockabilly of Everybody&apos;s Rockin&apos; (1983) was equally scorned, and Young soon settled into a cult audience for the mid-&apos;80s. &#xD;&#xA;Over the course of the mid-&apos;80s, Young released three albums that were all stylistic exercises. In 1985, he released the straight country Old Ways, which was followed by the new wave-tinged Landing on Water the following year. He returned to Crazy Horse for 1987&apos;s Life, but by that time, he and Geffen had grown sick of each other, and he returned to Reprise in 1988. His first album for Reprise was the bluesy, horn-driven This Note&apos;s for You, which was supported by an acclaimed video that satirized rock stars endorsing commercial products. At the end of the year, he recorded a reunion album with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash called American Dream, which was greeted with savagely negative reviews. &#xD;&#xA;American Dream didn&apos;t prepare any observer for the critical and commercial success of 1989&apos;s Freedom, which found Young following the half-acoustic/half-electric blueprint of Rust Never Sleeps to fine results. Around the time of its release, Young became a hip name to drop in indie rock circles, and he was the subject of a tribute record titled The Bridge in 1989. The following year, Young reunited with Crazy Horse for Ragged Glory, a loud, feedback-drenched album that received his strongest reviews since the &apos;70s. For the supporting tour, Young hired the avant rock band Sonic Youth as his opening group, providing them with needed exposure while earning him hip credibility within alternative rock scenes. On the advice of Sonic Youth, Young added the noise collage EP Arc as a bonus to his 1991 live album, Weld. &#xD;&#xA;Weld and the Sonic Youth tour helped position Neil Young as an alternative and grunge rock forefather, but he decided to abandon loud music for its 1992 follow-up, Harvest Moon. An explicit sequel to his 1972 breakthrough, Harvest Moon became Young&apos;s biggest hit in years, and he supported the record with an appearance on MTV Unplugged, which was released the following year as an album. Also in 1993, Geffen released the rarities collection Lucky Thirteen. The following year, he released Sleeps with Angels, which was hailed as a masterpiece in some quarters. Following its release, Young began jamming with Pearl Jam, eventually recording an album with the Seattle band in early 1995. The resulting record, Mirror Ball, was released to positive reviews in the summer of 1995, but it wasn&apos;t the commercial blockbuster it was expected to be; due to legal reasons, Pearl Jam&apos;s name was not allowed to be featured on the cover. &#xD;&#xA;In the summer of 1996, he reunited with Crazy Horse for Broken Arrow and supported it with a brief tour. That tour was documented in Jim Jarmusch&apos;s 1997 film The Year of the Horse, which was accompanied by a double-disc live album. In 1999, Young reunited with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash for the first time in a decade, supporting their Looking Forward LP with the supergroup&apos;s first tour in a quarter century. A new solo effort, Silver &amp; Gold, followed in the spring of 2000. In recognition of his 2000 summer tour, Young released the live album Road Rock, Vol. 1 the following fall, showcasing a two-night account of Young&apos;s performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado, in September 2000. A DVD version titled Red Rocks Live was issued that December, including 12 tracks initially unavailable on Road Rock, Vol. 1. His next studio project was his most ambitious yet, a concept album about small-town life titled Greendale that he also mounted as a live dramatic tour and indie film. &#xD;&#xA;In early 2005, Young was diagnosed with a potentially deadly brain aneurysm. Undergoing treatment didn&apos;t slow him down, however, as he continued to write and record his next project. The acoustically based Prairie Wind appeared in the fall, with the concert film Heart of Gold, based around the album and directed by Jonathan Demme, released in 2006. That year also saw the release of the controversial CD/DVD Living with War, a collection of protest songs against the war in Iraq that featured titles such as &quot;Let&apos;s Impeach the President,&quot; &quot;Shock and Awe,&quot; and &quot;Lookin&apos; for a Leader.&quot; Restless, prolific, and increasingly self-referential, Young issued Chrome Dreams II late in 2007 and the car-themed Fork in the Road in 2009. Later in 2009, Young finally released the first installment in his long-rumored Archives series, Archives, Vol. 1, a massive first volume that combined over ten CD and DVD discs in a single box. As he was prepping Archives, Vol. 2, Young entered the studio with producer Daniel Lanois and recorded Le Noise, which appeared in the fall of 2010. &#xD;&#xA;Young, Richie Furay, and Stephen Stills finally reunited as Buffalo Springfield for a pair of shows at Young&apos;s annual Bridge School Benefit in the fall of 2010. It wasn&apos;t a complete reunion, since bassist Bruce Palmer had died in 2004 and drummer Dewey Martin passed in 2009, but the three singers used drummer Joe Vitale and bassist Rick Rosas to fill in. The same configuration played six concerts in the spring of 2011 but reportedly did no studio work. Young continued going through his archives with the release of A Treasure in 2011, a single-disc set of live tracks recorded during his 1984-1985 tour with the International Harvesters that featured five previously unreleased Young songs mixed in with older songs like &quot;Flying on the Ground Is Wrong&quot; and &quot;Are You Ready for the Country?,&quot; all done in the classic Harvest style. In 2012, Young reunited with Crazy Horse for Americana, a set of classic folk tunes like &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; and &quot;Wayfarin&apos; Stranger,&quot; followed several months later by the double-disc album of originals Psychedelic Pill, which again saw Young turning to the guitar garage stomp of Crazy Horse. A month prior to the October release of Psychedelic Pill, Young published his memoir, Waging Heavy Peace. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59235/thumb/1445624818" art="/library/metadata/59235/art/1445624818" addedAt="1438448632" updatedAt="1445624818">

  <Directory ratingKey="64527" key="/library/metadata/64527/children" type="artist" title="Nightmares On Wax" summary="Originally the combined project of George Evelyn and Kevin &quot;Boywonder&quot; Harper -- the latter of whom was eventually replaced by Robin Taylor-Firth -- Nightmares on Wax became one of the brightest spots on the post-rave British techno map of the early &apos;90s. NoW&apos;s debut album, A Word of Science, was -- along with early tracks by LFO, Tuff Little Unit, and Tricky Disco -- a crucial bridge between the competing influences of New York house and electro, Detroit techno and soul, London rave and acid, and the burgeoning eclecticism of the years to come. Formed in the late &apos;80s in West Yorkshire as an extension of Evelyn and company&apos;s b-boy crew the Soul City Rockers, NoW&apos;s first singles, &quot;Dextrous&quot; and &quot;Aftermath,&quot; were both highly regarded, and the latter shot into the U.K. pop singles Top 40. The subsequent album laid a good deal of the groundwork for the downtempo experimental hip-hop/electro-funk worked over by Mike Paradinas, Luke Vibert, Spacer, and others, and earned the group a secure spot among techno&apos;s select crew of next-step innovators.&#xD;&#xA;The group nonetheless disbanded following Science&apos;s release, with early contributor Kevin Harper leaving to pursue a DJ career and Evelyn turning out a smattering of house tracks on Warp&apos;s Nucleus subsidiary before settling into bedroom woodshed mode. Following a four-year hiatus, Evelyn resurfaced with a track on the Mo&apos; Wax Headz compilation and, soon after, Smoker&apos;s Delight, basically an instrumental hip-hop album with a distinctively British eclecticism. Still involved with the same sorts of genre-spanning sampler-and-sequencer experiments, Smoker&apos;s Delight was also less obvious, suited more to repeat listenings than previous material. The same was also true for 1999&apos;s Carboot Soul, Evelyn&apos;s first album as part of a deal with American indie label Matador for domestic distribution. In 2000, NoW produced the first new track by De La Soul in several years, included on an EP -- Sound of N.O.W -- featuring the rap pioneers. Following on its heels was a volume in the Studio !K7 mix series DJ-Kicks. Two years later, Evelyn delivered his fourth LP, Mind Elevation. A bigger gap preceded the release of his next proper LP for Warp, but In a Space Outta Sound finally appeared in March 2006, while 2008&apos;s Thought So... -- the final NoW Warp release -- and 2009&apos;s Coming Home followed closely behind. Evelyn continued to work as a downtempo DJ, re-signed with Warp, collaborated with Jazzanova arranger Sebastian Studnitzky, and released Feelin&apos; Good, another eclectic set of productions, in 2013. ~ Sean Cooper" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64527/thumb/1445627380" art="/library/metadata/64527/art/1445627380" addedAt="1438447518" updatedAt="1445627380">

  <Directory ratingKey="59123" key="/library/metadata/59123/children" type="artist" title="No Doubt" summary="With the return of the punks in the mid-&apos;90s came a resurgence of their slightly more commercial rivals, new wave bands. No Doubt found a niche as a new wave/ska band, on the strength of vocalist Gwen Stefani&apos;s persona -- alternately an embrace of little-girl-lost innocence and riot grrrl feminism -- exemplified on the band&apos;s break-out single, &quot;Just a Girl.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;Formed in early 1987 as a ska band inspired by Madness, the lineup of No Doubt initially comprised John Spence, Gwen Stefani, and her brother Eric. While playing the party-band circuit around Anaheim, the trio picked up bassist Tony Kanal, born in India but raised in Great Britain and the U.S. Hardened by the suicide of Spence in December 1987, No Doubt nevertheless continued; Gwen became the lone vocalist and the group added guitarist Tom Dumont and drummer Adrian Young.&#xD;&#xA;No Doubt&apos;s live act began to attract regional interest, and Interscope Records signed them in 1991. The band&apos;s debut a year later, an odd fusion of &apos;80s pop and ska, sank without a trace in the wake of the grunge movement. As a result, Interscope refused to support No Doubt&apos;s tour or further recordings. The band responded by recording on their own during 1993-1994; the result was the self-released Beacon Street Collection, much rawer and more punk-inspired than the debut. Eric Stefani left just after its release, later working as an animator for The Simpsons.&#xD;&#xA;By late 1994, Interscope allowed recordings to resume, and Tragic Kingdom was released in October 1995. The album served as a document of the breakup of Gwen Stefani and Kanal, whose relationship had lasted seven years. Thanks to constant touring and the appearance of &quot;Just a Girl&quot; and &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; on MTV&apos;s Buzz Bin, the album hit the Top Ten in 1996. Stefani, who has made no secret of her pop ambitions, became a centerpiece of attention as an alternative to the crop of tough girls prevalent on the charts. By the end of the year, Tragic Kingdom hit number one on the album charts, almost a year after its first release; the record&apos;s third single, the ballad &quot;Don&apos;t Speak,&quot; was the band&apos;s biggest hit to date. &#xD;&#xA;No Doubt&apos;s much-anticipated follow-up, The Return of Saturn, was released in the spring of 2000, and &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot; and &quot;Ex-Girlfriend&quot; were both critically successful at the mainstream and college levels. A year later, Stefani also hooked up with rap chanteuse Eve for the single &quot;Let Me Blow Your Mind&quot; (it went on to earn a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2002); however, Stefani also joined her band for the release of their fifth album. The ska revival and new wave sounds of Rock Steady were issued hot on the heels of debut single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; in December 2001. &#xD;&#xA;Rock Steady generated several major hits -- the heavy synths of &quot;Hella Good&quot; and the seductive reggae of &quot;Underneath It All&quot; being the biggest -- and the group continued touring the record over the next couple of years, all leading to the release of the hits collection The Singles 1992-2003 in 2003. The following year the band took a hiatus of undetermined length as Stefani launched a solo career with 2004&apos;s Love.Angel.Music.Baby. This hiatus wound up lasting the better part of a decade, during which Stefani stayed in the spotlight via two hit solo albums (the second, The Sweet Escape, arriving in 2006), while the other bandmembers pursued other projects, the most prominent being Tony Kanal&apos;s collaborations with P!nk in 2008. No Doubt eased back into action in 2009 with a reunion tour accompanied by the announcement of an impending new album. That new record took a while to complete, but it was finally finished in 2012, and released as Push and Shove that fall. It was preceded by the single &quot;Settle Down.&quot; ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59123/thumb/1445624770" art="/library/metadata/59123/art/1445624770" addedAt="1438450450" updatedAt="1445624770">

  <Directory ratingKey="61278" key="/library/metadata/61278/children" type="artist" title="Oasis" summary="Oasis shot from obscurity to stardom in 1994, becoming one of Britain&apos;s most popular and critically acclaimed bands of the decade in the process. Along with Blur and Suede, they were responsible for returning British guitar pop to the top of the charts. Led by guitarist/songwriter Noel Gallagher, the Manchester quintet adopted the rough, thuggish image of the Stones and the Who, crossed it with &quot;Beatlesque&quot; melodies and hooks, injected distinctly British lyrical themes and song structures like the Jam and the Kinks, and tied it all together with a massive guitar roar, as well as a defiant sneer that drew equally from the Sex Pistols&apos; rebelliousness and the Stone Roses&apos; cocksure arrogance. Gallagher&apos;s songs frequently reworked previous hits from T. Rex (&quot;Cigarettes and Alcohol&quot; borrows the riff from &quot;Bang a Gong&quot;) to Wham! (&quot;Fade Away&quot; takes the melody from &quot;Freedom&quot;), yet the group always put the hooks in different settings, updating past hits for a new era.&#xD;&#xA;Originally, the group was formed by schoolmates Liam Gallagher (vocals), Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass), and Tony McCaroll (drums). After spending several years as the guitar technician for a Stone Roses-inspired group named the Inspiral Carpets, Noel Gallagher returned to Manchester to find that his brother had formed a band. Noel agreed to join if he could have complete control of the group, including contributing all the songs; the rest of the band agreed and adopted a new name, Oasis, before launching a year of intensive rehearsals.&#xD;&#xA;After playing a handful of small club gigs, the band cornered Alan McGee, the head of Creation Records, and forced him to listen to their demo. Impressed, he signed the band and helped them ready their debut album. The group released their first single, &quot;Supersonic,&quot; in the spring of 1994; it edged its way into the charts on the back of positive reviews. With a melody adapted from &quot;I&apos;d Like to Teach the World to Sing,&quot; &quot;Shakermaker&quot; became a bigger hit in the early summer. Released a month before their debut album&apos;s arrival, the soaring ballad &quot;Live Forever&quot; became a major hit in England and helped make Definitely Maybe the fastest-selling debut in British history. The record entered the charts at number one and eventually sold over seven million copies.&#xD;&#xA;Oasis mania continued throughout 1994, as the group began playing larger theaters and watched each new single outperform the last. However, tensions in the group began to build -- Liam and Noel refused to do joint interviews because they always fought -- and Noel Gallagher briefly left the band at the end of a difficult fall American tour. However, he quickly re-joined and the band headed back to England. As &quot;Supersonic&quot; began to climb the U.S. album rock and modern rock charts, the string-laden &quot;Whatever&quot; (a non-album single) hit number two over the British Christmas season.&#xD;&#xA;At the beginning of 1995, the group set their sights on America by promoting the single &quot;Live Forever.&quot; The song became a major hit on MTV and modern rock radio stations, peaking at number two, and Definitely Maybe soon climbed to gold status in the U.S. Returning to England after a sold-out American tour, the group recorded a new single, &quot;Some Might Say.&quot; Drummer Tony McCaroll parted ways with the band on the eve of the single&apos;s May release, with Alan White taking his place. &quot;Some Might Say&quot; entered the charts at number one, and its success led to all of Oasis&apos; previous singles reentering the indie charts. Oasis spent the rest of the summer completing their second album, (What&apos;s the Story) Morning Glory?, which was released in October of 1995. Upon its release, the album shot to number one in England, becoming the fastest-selling album in the U.K. since Michael Jackson&apos;s Bad.&#xD;&#xA;The band continued to set records during the following years. Over the course of 1996, (What&apos;s the Story) Morning Glory? became the second-biggest British album in history. On the strength of the iconic single &quot;Wonderwall,&quot; Morning Glory also became a Top Ten success in America, where it reached quintuple platinum status; it also cracked the Top Ten throughout countries in Europe and Asia. During 1996, the Gallaghers&apos; combative relationship was frequently detailed in newspapers and gossip columns, particularly when they suddenly pulled out of their late summer U.S. tour. This followed the group&apos;s two concerts at Knebworth, which broke records for being the biggest outdoor concert in England. &#xD;&#xA;After Oasis abandoned their American tour, they concentrated on recording their third album. While the band&apos;s first two LPs were quickly recorded, they took several months to record the third, which finally saw completion during the spring of 1997. The resulting album, Be Here Now, was released in late August, one month after the arrival of the single &quot;D&apos;You Know What I Mean.&quot; Greeted with generally enthusiastic reviews and robust sales, Be Here Now shattered sales records in the U.K. and nearly topped the U.S. charts, positioning the quintet as the de facto rulers of rock. However, a backlash set in among both critics and record buyers over the album&apos;s perceived excesses, which meant that Be Here Now lacked the shelf life of its predecessors. Not long afterward, typical infighting unraveled the band&apos;s tour, and the group disappeared from the spotlight for a time -- although a collection of B-sides, Masterplan, did follow in 1998. &#xD;&#xA;As the band was recording their fourth album in the summer of 1999, Bonehead left Oasis, claiming that he wanted to spend more time with his family. Interviewed by NME on August 11, the day after the departure was made public, Noel Gallagher seemed unfazed, stating &quot;It&apos;s hardly Paul McCartney leaving the Beatles.&quot; Ex-Ride guitarist Andy Bell and onetime Heavy Stereo guitarist Gem Archer signed on after the recording of 2000&apos;s Standing on the Shoulder of Giants was completed. In fall 2000, the band celebrated their monumental world tour success with the release of their first-ever live record, Familiar to Millions. The album highlights Oasis&apos; July 2000 gig at Wembley Stadium and was released on six different formats including CD and cassette, DVD, VHS, triple vinyl, and mini-disc. &#xD;&#xA;Two years later, Oasis surfaced with Heathen Chemistry. Worldwide dates coincided the release of Oasis&apos; fifth studio album; however, problems loomed ahead. While touring America in late summer, Noel Gallagher, Andy Bell, and touring keyboardist Jay Darlington were injured in Indianapolis after their taxi collided with another vehicle. The band bounced back soon, returning to the road in two weeks time after canceling shows in Indianapolis, Boston, and Philadelphia. In America, however, the album wasn&apos;t faring as well as Oasis&apos; tour sales, and the leadoff single &quot;Hindu Times&quot; barely made a mark on MTV. More trouble arrived in December, when Liam Gallagher and several members of the Oasis entourage were involved in a street scuffle in Munich; the younger Gallagher sustained facial injuries and was later arrested while two of the band&apos;s security guards sought serious medical attention. Despite such setbacks -- which also included mixed reviews for the album -- Heathen Chemistry nevertheless sold several million copies at home and charted four U.K. singles. Additionally, Liam&apos;s own composition, &quot;Songbird,&quot; marked the first time Oasis had released a single penned by anyone other than Noel. The song fared well on U.K. charts and paved the way for a new collaborative approach to songwriting.&#xD;&#xA;Oasis&apos; next album suffered delays, as initial sessions with the electronica duo Death in Vegas (who had been recruited to produce the record) were scrapped. Additionally, drummer Alan White made his exit from the band in early 2004, and Ringo Starr&apos;s son Zak Starkey climbed aboard to take his place. Don&apos;t Believe the Truth eventually saw a worldwide release in May 2005. Featuring songwriting contributions from every bandmember, the record represented a new approach from the previously Noel-dominated group. &quot;Lyla,&quot; &quot;The Importance of Being Idle,&quot; and &quot;Let There Be Love&quot; all contributed to the album&apos;s success, and Don&apos;t Believe the Truth soon became the band&apos;s highest-selling effort since Be Here Now. The band quickly returned to the studio in mid-2007, halting production several months later to allow Noel to spend time with his newborn child. Sessions resumed in November and wrapped up in 2008, with Dig Out Your Soul receiving a release date later that year. In 2009, after a typically heated, backstage sibling altercation, Noel left the group for good, prompting Liam (and the rest of the band) to change the name to Beady Eye, with plans to release a debut single in 2010. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61278/thumb/1445625604" art="/library/metadata/61278/art/1445625604" addedAt="1438452669" updatedAt="1445625604">

Hailing from London, Leontiou had started his recording career several years earlier as a solo artist. After signing a major-label recording deal with Polydor, he made his full-length solo album debut in 2004 with Some Day Soon. The album was a hit in the United Kingdom, spawning the Top Ten hit single &quot;Story of My Life&quot; and going gold on the strength of several other hits. Leontiou was unhappy with the direction of his solo career, however, and adopted the One eskimO moniker for a guest appearance on the song &quot;Hope &amp; Glory,&quot; which appeared on the Faithless album To All New Arrivals in 2006. Before long, he had abandoned his solo work altogether, and One eskimO expanded to become a quartet comprised of Pete Rinaldi (guitar), Jamie Sefton (bass, horns), and Adam Falkner (drums), in addition to Leontiou on lead vocals. &#xD;&#xA;With a full lineup in place, One eskimO made its commercial debut in 2007 with the single &quot;Hometime.&quot; Released independently on the Little Polar Records label, &quot;Hometime&quot; was licensed for use in a Toyota Prius advertisement in the United States. A couple years later, the band released &quot;Kandi&quot; as the follow-up single, as well as the tellingly titled Debut EP, a four-track EP released stateside in 2009.

  <Directory ratingKey="62191" key="/library/metadata/62191/children" type="artist" title="The Orb" titleSort="Orb" summary="The Orb virtually invented the electronic genre known as ambient house, resurrecting slower, more soulful rhythms and providing a soundtrack for early-morning ravers once the clubs closed their doors. The group popularized the genre as well, by appearing on the British chart show Top of the Pops and hitting number one in the U.K. with the 1992 album U.F.Orb. Frontman Dr. Alex Paterson&apos;s formula was quite simple: he slowed down the rhythms of classic Chicago house and added synth work and effects inspired by &apos;70s ambient pioneers Brian Eno and Tangerine Dream. To make the whole a bit more listenable -- as opposed to danceable -- obscure vocal samples were looped, usually providing a theme for tracks which lacked singing.&#xD;&#xA;Paterson had worked as a roadie for Killing Joke during the &apos;80s, and began to be influenced by the explosion of Chicago house music in England during the mid- to late &apos;80s. He joined the A&amp;R department of EG Records -- the home of Brian Eno himself -- and first recorded as the Orb with Jimi Cauty (who had played in the Killing Joke side project Brilliant and later gained fame as one half of the KLF). The duo&apos;s first release as the Orb, a failed acid house anthem named &quot;Tripping on Sunshine,&quot; appeared on the 1988 compilation album Eternity Project One. In May 1989, the Orb released the Kiss EP, a four-tracker dedicated to -- and heavily sampled from -- New York&apos;s KISS-FM. Paterson had begun to DJ in London around this time, and Paul Oakenfold recruited him to man Land of Oz, the chill-out room at his club Heaven.&#xD;&#xA;Paterson&apos;s ambient sets incorporated a wide array of samples and sound effects, ranging from BBC nature recordings to NASA space broadcasts and special effects. With those samples mixed underneath the music of ambient pioneers such as Eno and Steve Hillage, his sets became popular alternatives for dancefloor victims and worn-out club kids. Hillage happened to be in the room one night when Paterson sampled his Rainbow Dome Musick album. The two became friends and later recorded together, Hillage contributing guitar to the Orb&apos;s &quot;Blue Room&quot; single and Paterson working on the debut album by Hillage&apos;s System 7 project (or 777, as it is known in the States due to copyright problems with Apple).&#xD;&#xA;The Orb&apos;s first actual foray into ambient house appeared in October 1989 on Paterson&apos;s WAU!/Mr. Modo label. The 22-minute single &quot;A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld,&quot; which sampled ocean noises and Minnie Riperton&apos;s &quot;Loving You,&quot; actually hit the U.K. charts that year. The single became popular with indie kids as well as club DJs, and earned Paterson and Cauty the chance to re-record the song in December 1989 for a John Peel session. (That version was released two years later, alongside their second session, on the Orb&apos;s Peel Sessions album.)&#xD;&#xA;In early 1990, Dave Stewart asked Paterson and Cauty to remix his single &quot;Lilly Was Here&quot;; the track hit the U.K.&apos;s Top 20, and the Orb&apos;s remix work soon became just as popular as their original material. Erasure, Depeche Mode, Yello, Primal Scream, and more than 20 other bands eventually received the remix treatment before Paterson began to cut back his remixing work in 1992. (One of the only outside remixes of Orb material occurred around this time when breakbeat pioneers Coldcut remixed the Kiss EP for a U.S.-only single.)&#xD;&#xA;Alex Paterson and Jimi Cauty had been recording an album during the turn of 1989-1990, but the two split in April 1990 -- a result of Paterson&apos;s fear that the Orb had become known more as a KLF side project than an original act. Cauty stripped Paterson&apos;s contribution to the recordings and released the eponymous album -- credited simply as Space -- later that year. (Cauty released another ambient album that year: Chill Out, this time with his KLF partner Bill Drummond.) In the meantime, Alex Paterson had been working with Youth (from Killing Joke) on the new track &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds,&quot; with a melody incorporated from composer Steve Reich. The single appeared in November 1990, sparking the wrath of the sampled Rickie Lee Jones, whose dialogue with LeVar Burton -- from the PBS children&apos;s program Reading Rainbow -- was sampled for the chorus and title of the track; Big Life later settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Though the single failed to place in the charts, its laid-back vibe made it a big hit on the dancefloor.&#xD;&#xA;Youth&apos;s other commitments made it impossible for him to become a permanent member of the Orb, so Paterson decided to recruit Kris Weston (nicknamed Thrash for his punk/metal roots), a young studio engineer who worked on &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot; and had recently left his previous band, Fortran 5. The Orb performed live for the first time just after the pairing, early in 1991 at London&apos;s Town &amp; Country 2 with Steve Hillage on guitar. The group&apos;s live dates soon became their forte, breaking down the boundaries which had previously separated electronic music from rock. An Orb show encompassed the best elements of performance hall and club, with colorful light shows and visuals, and a relaxed, positive groove rarely found in electronic circles.&#xD;&#xA;All this was fine and good, but the Orb had not yet released an album, the vehicle which virtually all modern musicians use to make artistic statements. Finally, in April 1991, The Orb&apos;s Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld was released in England to considerable critical acclaim. Its popularity extended to the general public as well, pushing the double album into Great Britain&apos;s Top 30 LP charts. By mid-1991, the Orb had signed a deal to release Ultraworld in the States, but were forced to edit the album down to one disc. (The full double-disc version was later released in the U.S. by Island.) Paterson and Thrash toured Europe during 1991, and compiled the Orb&apos;s first two Peel Sessions that November. One month later, the duo released The Aubrey Mixes as a Christmas special. The album, a remix compilation with reworkings by Steve Hillage, Youth, and Jimi Cauty, was deleted on the day of its release, but still managed to place in the U.K. Top 50.&#xD;&#xA;In June 1992, the new single &quot;Blue Room&quot; hit the British Top Ten. The longest single in chart history at just under 40 minutes, it earned the Orb a spot on Top of the Pops, where they ruminated over a chess game and waved at the camera while a three-minute edit of the single played in the background. Released in July, the album U.F.Orb concentrated not on space, but the beings that inhabit it. (The actual &quot;Blue Room&quot; is an installation where the U.S. government allegedly keeps the relics of a 1947 saucer crash outside Roswell, New Mexico.) It hit number one on the British album charts, and also did well with critics, who praised it and the duo&apos;s sold-out tour of England.&#xD;&#xA;The non-album single &quot;Assassin&quot; -- originally slated to feature vocals from Primal Scream&apos;s Bobby Gillespie -- followed in October, and it reached number 12 on the British charts. The U.S. release of U.F.Orb appeared two months later, with initial copies including a second disc with the full version of &quot;Blue Room&quot; plus mixes of &quot;Assassin.&quot; A limited LP release of U.F.Orb in England included a live recording of the Orb&apos;s appearance at London&apos;s Brixton Academy in 1991. (The date was later released on video with an added CD soundtrack as Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld: Patterns and Textures.)&#xD;&#xA;Though the Orb had released several hours of recordings and many remixes during its first three years of existence, the beginning of 1993 prompted a dry spell of over a year and a half. The problem wasn&apos;t a lack of material; Paterson and Thrash continued to record, but Big Life Records had begun a controversial campaign to reissue several early singles. The Orb threatened to release no new material until the label promised to cease and desist, and negotiations stalled while the duo looked to opt out of their contract. In the meantime, Big Life spent 1993-1994 reissuing five CD singles and two other 12&quot; releases, including &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot; (which hit the British Top Ten), &quot;Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain,&quot; and &quot;Perpetual Dawn&quot; (the second single from Ultraworld). Paterson finally signed an international deal with Island in 1993 and released the stopgap Live 93 later that year. The double-disc set -- which hit number 23 in the album charts -- included highlights from Orb appearances in Europe and Japan, and featured another clever dig at Pink Floyd: the cover has a large stuffed sheep suspended over a power station, Ã  la Floyd&apos;s Animals cover.&#xD;&#xA;The Orb&apos;s first studio release for Island appeared in June 1994. Pomme Fritz (a &quot;little album&quot;) was quite a departure from ambient house, the field that had since caught up with Paterson&apos;s revolution of the late &apos;80s. The album has a schizophrenic quality that portrays the group caught between two worlds: the pastoral ambience of the first two albums and the harsher, almost industrial rhythms that the Orb were pushing forward. Pomme Fritz made number six on the British charts, but critics hated it, charging that Paterson had finally disappeared up his own arse. They even compared him to Pink Floyd&apos;s own Syd Barrett, who masterminded the psychedelic classic Piper at the Gates of Dawn, but later slipped out of the band as the world&apos;s first -- and most popular -- acid casualty.&#xD;&#xA;Pomme Fritz was also a watershed in that the role of Kris Weston had diminished highly. Credited on Pomme Fritz only as an engineer, Weston did appear with Paterson on the August 1994 side project FFWD, the collaboration between Robert Fripp, Orb members Paterson and Weston, and Orb contributor Thomas Fehlmann (hence the name: Fripp, Fehlmann, Weston, and Doctor). By early 1995, Weston finally left the Orb to devote time to his own projects. Before the duo separated, however, they teamed for the Orb&apos;s most famous live appearance: on a rave bill at Woodstock 2 with Orbital, Aphex Twin, and Deee-Lite.&#xD;&#xA;Taking up the slack from Weston&apos;s departure was Thomas Fehlmann. The Orb had previously remixed a single from his Sun Electric project, and most of Pomme Fritz was recorded at his Berlin studios. Finally, almost three years after U.F.Orb, the new and improved group released the Orb&apos;s third studio LP, Orbus Terrarum. With a concept and a sound rooted firmly on terra firma, the album&apos;s dense rhythms and return to natural samples heralded a turn away from the cosmic fascination within ambient house -- which had been nurtured in large part by Ultraworld and U.F.Orb. During 1995, Paterson and Fehlmann mounted an ambitious world tour. After the release of a double-disc remix compilation, the Orb returned to the great beyond with the spacy sounds of 1997&apos;s Orblivion. The retrospective U.F.Off followed in 1998, and though Paterson and company finished their fifth studio effort, Cydonia, soon after, Island delayed its release until the new millennium.&#xD;&#xA;A shift in labels was in order, so 2004&apos;s Bicycles &amp; Tricycles found the Orb on Sanctuary. Working their next label change into the album title, Okie Dokie It&apos;s the Orb on Kompakt appeared at the end of 2005, as did the first volume in the rarities compilation series Orbsessions, released by the Killing Joke-associated label Malicious Damage. The Dream, released in 2007 in England, featured a change of lineup; joining the Orb were Youth, last heard on the hit single &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds,&quot; and Dreadzone&apos;s Tim Bran. The record appeared in 2008 on the American label Six Degrees. One year later, another volume in the Orbsessions series appeared, this a soundtrack recorded by Paterson and Thomas Fehlmann. (Although the film&apos;s title was Plastic Planet, the record itself was titled Baghdad Batteries.) Youth and Paterson collaborated again on the Orb&apos;s next proper album, Metallic Spheres, which also featured Pink Floyd&apos;s David Gilmour contributing guitar and lap steel to the album&apos;s two lengthy pieces. The 2011 release C Batter C featured a 17-minute Paterson/Fehlmann composition recorded for Battersea Bunches, a short film featuring Super 8 Paterson family footage from 1956. Seven remixes of the track filled out the disc. The next Orb project, 2012&apos;s The Observer in the Star House, featured a starring role for seminal dub producer and longtime Orb influence Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, along with a remix of &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds,&quot; dubbed &quot;Golden Clouds.&quot; ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/62191/thumb/1445626039" art="/library/metadata/62191/art/1445626039" addedAt="1438448365" updatedAt="1445626039">

  <Directory ratingKey="62170" key="/library/metadata/62170/children" type="artist" title="The Orb Feat. David Gilmour" titleSort="Orb Feat. David Gilmour" summary="The Orb virtually invented the electronic genre known as ambient house, resurrecting slower, more soulful rhythms and providing a soundtrack for early-morning ravers once the clubs closed their doors. The group popularized the genre as well, by appearing on the British chart show Top of the Pops and hitting number one in the U.K. with the 1992 album U.F.Orb. Frontman Dr. Alex Paterson&apos;s formula was quite simple: he slowed down the rhythms of classic Chicago house and added synth work and effects inspired by &apos;70s ambient pioneers Brian Eno and Tangerine Dream. To make the whole a bit more listenable -- as opposed to danceable -- obscure vocal samples were looped, usually providing a theme for tracks which lacked singing.&#xD;&#xA;Paterson had worked as a roadie for Killing Joke during the &apos;80s, and began to be influenced by the explosion of Chicago house music in England during the mid- to late &apos;80s. He joined the A&amp;R department of EG Records -- the home of Brian Eno himself -- and first recorded as the Orb with Jimi Cauty (who had played in the Killing Joke side project Brilliant and later gained fame as one half of the KLF). The duo&apos;s first release as the Orb, a failed acid house anthem named &quot;Tripping on Sunshine,&quot; appeared on the 1988 compilation album Eternity Project One. In May 1989, the Orb released the Kiss EP, a four-tracker dedicated to -- and heavily sampled from -- New York&apos;s KISS-FM.

  <Directory ratingKey="64457" key="/library/metadata/64457/children" type="artist" title="Orbital" summary="Orbital became one of the biggest names in techno during the mid-&apos;90s by solving the irreconcilable differences previously inherent in the genre: to stay true to the dance underground and, at the same time, force entry into the rock arena, where an album functions as an artistic statement -- not a collection of singles -- and a band&apos;s prowess is demonstrated by the actual performance of live music. Though Phil and Paul Hartnoll first charted with a single, the 1990 British Top 20 hit &quot;Chime,&quot; the duo later became known for critically praised albums. The LPs sold well with rock fans as well as electronic listeners, thanks to Orbital&apos;s busy tour schedule, which included headlining positions at such varied spots as the Glastonbury Festival, the Royal Albert Hall, and Tribal Gathering.&#xD;&#xA;The brothers Hartnoll -- Phil (born January 9, 1964) and Paul (born May 19, 1968) -- grew up in Dartford, Kent, listening to early-&apos;80s punk and electro. During the mid-&apos;80s, Phil worked as a bricklayer while Paul played with a local band called Noddy &amp; the Satellites. They began recording together in 1987 with a four-track, keyboards, and a drum machine, and sent their first composition, &quot;Chime&quot; (recorded and mastered onto a cassette tape for a total production cost of Â£2.50), into Jazzy M&apos;s pioneering house mix show Jackin&apos; Zone. By 1989, &quot;Chime&quot; was released as a single, the first on Jazzy M&apos;s label, Oh-Zone Records. The following year, ffrr Records re-released the single and signed a contract with the duo -- christened Orbital in honor of the M25, the circular London expressway which speeded thousands of club kids to the hinterlands for raves during the blissed-out Summer of Love. &quot;Chime&quot; hit number 17 on the British charts in March 1990 and led to an appearance on the TV chart show Top of the Pops, where the Hartnolls stared at the audience from behind their synth banks. &quot;Omen&quot; barely missed the Top 40 in September, but &quot;Satan&quot; made number 31 early in 1991, with a sample lifted from the Butthole Surfers.&#xD;&#xA;Orbital&apos;s untitled first LP, released in September 1991, consisted of all-new material -- that is, if live versions of &quot;Chime&quot; and the fourth single &quot;Midnight&quot; are considered new works. Unlike the Hartnolls&apos; later albums, though, the debut was more of a collection of songs than a true full-length work, its cut-and-paste attitude typical of many techno LPs of the time. During 1992, Orbital continued their chart success with two EPs. The Mutations remix work -- with contributions from Meat Beat Manifesto, Moby, and Joey Beltram -- hit number 24 in February. Orbital returned Meat Beat&apos;s favor later that year by remixing &quot;Edge of No Control,&quot; and later reworked songs by Queen Latifah, the Shamen, and EMF as well. The second EP, Radiccio, reached the Top 40 in September. It marked the Hartnolls&apos; debut for Internal Records in England, though ffrr retained control of the duo&apos;s American contract, beginning with a U.S. release of the debut album in 1992.&#xD;&#xA;The duo entered 1993 ready to free techno from its club restraints, beginning in June with a second LP. Also untitled, but nicknamed the &quot;brown&quot; album as an alternative to the &quot;green&quot; debut, it unified the disjointed feel of its predecessor and hit number 28 on the British charts. The Hartnolls continued the electronic revolution that fall during their first American tour. Phil and Paul had first played live at a pub in Kent in 1989 -- before the release of &quot;Chime&quot; -- and had continued to make concert performance a cornerstone of their appeal during 1991-1993, though the U.S. had remained unaware of the fact. On a tour with Moby and Aphex Twin, Orbital proved to Americans that techno shows could actually be diverting for the undrugged multitudes. With no reliance on DATs (the savior of most live techno acts), Phil and Paul allowed an element of improvisation into the previously sterile field, making their live shows actually sound live. The concerts were just as entertaining to watch as well, with the Hartnolls&apos; constant presence behind the banks -- a pair of flashlights attached to each head, bobbing in time to the music -- underscoring the impressive light shows and visuals. The early-1994 release of the Peel Sessions EP, recorded live at the BBC&apos;s Maida Vale Studios, cemented onto wax what concertgoers already knew. That summer proved to be the pinnacle of Orbital&apos;s performance ascent; an appearance at Woodstock 2 and a headlining spot at the Glastonbury Festival (both to rave reviews) confirmed the duo&apos;s status as one of the premier live acts in the field of popular music, period.&#xD;&#xA;The U.S.-only Diversions EP -- released in March 1994 as a supplement to the second LP -- selected tracks from both the Peel Sessions and the album&apos;s single, &quot;Lush.&quot; Following in August 1994, Snivilisation became Orbital&apos;s first named LP. The duo had not left political/social comment completely behind on the previous album -- &quot;Halcyon + On + On&quot; was in fact a response to the drug used for seven years by the Hartnolls&apos; own mother -- but Snivilisation pushed Orbital into the much more active world of political protest. It focused on the Criminal Justice Bill of 1994, which gave police greater legal action both to break up raves and prosecute the promoters and participants. The wide variety of styles signaled that this was Orbital&apos;s most accomplished work. Snivilisation also became the duo&apos;s biggest hit, reaching number four in Great Britain&apos;s album charts.&#xD;&#xA;During 1995, the brothers concerned themselves with touring, headlining the Glastonbury Festival in addition to the dance extravaganza Tribal Gathering. In May 1996, Orbital set out on quite a different tour altogether; the duo played untraditional, seated venues -- including the prestigious Royal Albert Hall -- and appeared on-stage earlier in the night, much like typical rock bands. Two months later, Phil and Paul released &quot;The Box,&quot; a 28-minute single of orchestral proportions. It screamed of prog rock excess -- especially the inclusion of synth harpsichords -- and appeared to be the first misstep in a very studied career. The resulting In Sides, however, became their most acclaimed album, with many excellent reviews in publications that had never covered electronic music. It was over three years before the release of Orbital&apos;s next album, 1999&apos;s Middle of Nowhere. An aggressive, experimental album titled The Altogether emerged in 2001, and one year later Orbital celebrated over a decade together with the release of the retrospective Work 1989-2002. With the release of 2004&apos;s Blue Album, however, the Hartnolls announced that they were disbanding Orbital. After the split, Paul began recording music under his own name, including material for the Wipeout Pure PSP game and a solo album (The Ideal Condition), while Phil formed another duo, Long Range, with Nick Smith. &#xD;&#xA;Unsurprisingly, that wasn&apos;t the end of their partnership. Five years after the Blue Album, the Hartnolls announced their live reunion for 2009&apos;s Big Chill Festival, as well as a 20th anniversary tour. The collection 20 followed in due course, as did a comeback single, 2010&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Stop Me.&quot; In 2012, their eighth full-length, Wonky, appeared, with a throwback sound inspired partly by its producer, Flood, and partly by Orbital&apos;s sound back in the early &apos;90s. Later in the year, they provided the score for the Luis Prieto-directed film Pusher. ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64457/thumb/1445627390" art="/library/metadata/64457/art/1445627390" addedAt="1438447560" updatedAt="1445627390">

Co-founders Jason Pebworth (vocals) and George Astasio (guitar) borrowed the name from cinematic icon Orson Welles, and their Tinseltown origins also inspired the band&apos;s decision to perform in vintage suits and fedoras. Lead guitarist Chad Rachild, bassist Johnny Lonely, and drummer Chris Cano completed the original lineup, which gigged throughout the Los Angeles area to little notice until the fall of 2005, when Orson self-released their debut LP, Bright Idea. Rachild resigned soon after the record&apos;s release, and upon adding new guitarist Kevin Roentgen, Orson toured the U.K. and immediately found favor with the mercurial British music press, further cultivating their European fan base via opening dates for Duran Duran. After a brief return to Hollywood, Orson relocated to London in early 2006, signing to Mercury and reissuing Bright Idea in the spring. The album topped the U.K. charts, and the lead single &quot;No Tomorrow&quot; hit number one as well. In 2007, the band appeared at the Concert for Diana and released their second album, Culture Vultures, which won them Best International Breakthrough Act at the Brit Awards. After some more touring and festival appearances, however, they decided to call it a day. Pebworth and Astasio, together with Xenomania&apos;s Jon Shave, started a successful backroom songwriting collaboration dubbed The Invisible Men; Cano, Lonely and Roentgen went on to form the band Goldsboro. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61265/thumb/1445625587" addedAt="1438452623" updatedAt="1445625587">

  <Directory ratingKey="61232" key="/library/metadata/61232/children" type="artist" title="P!nk" summary="Although initially viewed as another face in the late-&apos;90s crowd of teen pop acts, Pink (professionally known as P!nk) quickly transcended and outgrew that label with her combination of pop songcraft and powerhouse, rock-influenced vocals. Born Alecia Moore on September 8, 1979, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, Pink received her nickname as a child, years before she dyed her hair accordingly. She grew up in a musical family and was a regular on the Philadelphia club scene by the age of 13, first as a dancer and then as a backing vocalist for the local hip-hop group Schoolz of Thought. At 14, she began writing her own songs; the same year, a local DJ at Club Fever began inviting her on-stage to sing a song every Friday.&#xD;&#xA;Pink was spotted one night by an executive for MCA Records, who asked her to audition for an R&amp;B group called Basic Instinct. Although Pink&apos;s strong vocals landed her the gig, the group imploded not long after. She was quickly recruited for a female R&amp;B trio called Choice, who signed to L.A. Reid and Babyface&apos;s LaFace label on the strength of their demo; however, they too disbanded due to differences over musical direction. During Choice&apos;s brief studio time, producer Daryl Simmons asked Pink to write a bridge section for the song &quot;Just to Be Loving You.&quot; Impressed with the results, Pink rediscovered her songwriting muse, and an equally impressed L.A. Reid soon gave her a solo deal with LaFace.&#xD;&#xA;Pink recorded her solo debut, Can&apos;t Take Me Home, with a variety of songwriting partners and dance-pop and R&amp;B producers. Released in 2000, the album was a double-platinum hit; it spun off three Top Ten singles in &quot;There U Go,&quot; &quot;Most Girls,&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Sick.&quot; She toured that summer as the opening act for *N Sync, but soon found herself tired of being pigeonholed as strictly a teen act despite her sassy, forthright persona. As she set about working on her follow-up album, Pink took part in the remake of Patti LaBelle&apos;s &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; featured on the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, which also featured powerhouse divas Christina Aguilera, Mya, and Lil&apos; Kim. The song was a massive hit, topping the charts in both the U.S. and U.K. while expanding Pink&apos;s own audience.&#xD;&#xA;Toward the end of the year, Pink released her next single, &quot;Get the Party Started,&quot; which climbed into the Top Five and became the singer&apos;s most inescapable hit to date. Her accompanying sophomore album, M!ssundaztood, quickly went double platinum; it boasted a more personal voice and an eclectic sound, plus heavy contributions from ex-4 Non Blondes singer Linda Perry, who helped bring some more rock muscle to Pink&apos;s sound (as did guest appearances by Steven Tyler and Richie Sambora). M!ssundaztood attracted positive critical notices as well, and its second single, &quot;Don&apos;t Let Me Get Me,&quot; became another fast-rising Top Ten hit. &#xD;&#xA;Pink next issued Try This in November 2003. The album continued her progression toward more rock-oriented material, due in part to the songwriting collaboration of Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong on eight of the album&apos;s tracks. Try This&apos; lead single, &quot;Trouble,&quot; cracked the upper regions of Billboard&apos;s Top 40 and earned Pink a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. On the home front, Pink wed motocross racer Carey Hart -- whom she had initially met at 2001&apos;s X-Games -- on January 7, 2006, in Costa Rica. &#xD;&#xA;Her next album, I&apos;m Not Dead, appeared that April; its first single, &quot;Stupid Girls,&quot; quickly became a hit, while &quot;Who Knew&quot; and &quot;U + Ur Hand&quot; both cracked the Top Ten. I&apos;m Not Dead reached platinum status in several countries and helped ramp up anticipation for Pink&apos;s follow-up, Funhouse, which arrived in October 2008. &quot;So What,&quot; the album&apos;s leadoff single, became her first number one hit since &quot;Lady Marmalade.&quot; Another hit, &quot;Please Don&apos;t Leave Me,&quot; followed in 2009 and all her hits were collected on the 2010 release Greatest Hits...So Far!!!, which was preceded by the single &quot;Raise Your Glass.&quot; Around the time of the release of Greatest Hits...So Far!!! Pink announced that she and her husband were expecting their first child. &#xD;&#xA;In 2012, Pink released her sixth studio album, The Truth About Love. With production from Greg Kurstin, Butch Walker, Max Martin, Dan Wilson, and others, the album featured such singles as &quot;Blow Me (One Last Kiss)&quot; and &quot;Try.&quot; ~ Steve Huey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61232/thumb/1445625615" art="/library/metadata/61232/art/1445625615" addedAt="1438451458" updatedAt="1445625615">

Dawn" summary="Comprised of brothers Prince Be (Attrell Cordes) and DJ Minute Mix (Jarrett Cordes), the early-&apos;90s group P.M. Dawn straddled the gap between hip-hop and smooth &apos;70s-style soul, creating an innovative urban R&amp;B that owed as much to pop as it did to rhythm and blues. The brothers recorded their debut single, &quot;Ode to a Forgetful Mind,&quot; in 1988, but P.M. Dawn didn&apos;t release a full-length album until 1991. The record, Of the Heart, of the Soul, of the Cross: The Utopian Experience, was an immediate hit, thanks to the single &quot;Set Adrift on Memory Bliss,&quot; which sampled Spandau Ballet&apos;s new wave hit &quot;True.&quot; Both the album and the single received glowing reviews, as did the 1993 follow-up, The Bliss Album?, which featured the hit singles &quot;I&apos;d Die Without You&quot; and &quot;Looking Through Patient Eyes.&quot; In 1995, P.M. Dawn returned with Jesus Wept, which received strong reviews but weak sales. Dearest Christian, I&apos;m So Very Sorry for Bringing You Here.

Plant and Page didn&apos;t invite bassist John Paul Jones to join the reunion, choosing to assemble a band comprised of studio musicians. No Quarter performed respectably and the duo&apos;s subsequent 1995 tour was a sold-out success, prompting them to take a stab at a studio project. In 1997, they hired indie rock producer Steve Albini to work on their collection of new original songs; it was the first time Page chose to work with an outside producer.

  <Directory ratingKey="64444" key="/library/metadata/64444/children" type="artist" title="Paramore" summary="Although their blend of emo-pop and slick, anthemic rock &amp; roll eventually made them stars on both sides of the Atlantic, Paramore began humbly enough in Franklin, Tennessee, where Hayley Williams met brothers Josh and Zac Farro after moving to town from Mississippi. Already a powerhouse vocalist at the age of 13, Williams joined a band that the Farro siblings had formed with local guitarist Taylor York. She left the group soon after, signing with Atlantic Records as a solo artist instead, but clashed with the label over the direction of her music. Seeking to front her own band, Williams convinced Atlantic to let her piece together a full lineup. Josh and Zac Farro were recruited for the job, as were guitarist Jason Bynum and bassist Jeremy Davis. &#xD;&#xA;From the start, Paramore&apos;s poppy melodies and zippy songwriting seemed to contradict the fact that none of the bandmates (with the exception of Davis) were older than 18. To help attract a younger audience, Atlantic decided to share the band with Fueled by Ramen, a Florida-based label with a strong roster of emo-pop acts. Fueled by Ramen officially co-signed the group in April 2005, and Paramore&apos;s full-length debut, All We Know Is Falling, was released later that summer. In addition to a performance at New Jersey&apos;s Bamboozle Festival and multiple dates on the Warped Tour circuit, Paramore played shows with such simpatico bands as Simple Plan and Straylight Run. Hunter Lamb replaced Bynum on guitar in December 2005, and the band spent the following summer on the Warped Tour once again, cementing its relationship with the fans who had caught the previous summer&apos;s shows. Lamb parted ways with the group in early 2007 to get married, and Paramore continued onward as a quartet. &#xD;&#xA;The following summer saw the release of the band&apos;s sophomore album, Riot!, which was recorded alongside producer David Bendeth. Buoyed by the popular singles &quot;Misery Business,&quot; &quot;crushcrushcrush,&quot; and &quot;That&apos;s What You Get,&quot; Riot! turned Paramore into industry heavyweights, going platinum within its first 13 months of release and earning the band a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. With original guitarist Taylor York now back on board, Paramore toured exhaustively in support of the record, even landing a two-month jaunt across the continental U.S. with their idols, Jimmy Eat World. Meanwhile, the band found time to contribute two songs to the best-selling Twilight soundtrack, including the Top 40 single &quot;Decode.&quot; A live album entitled The Final Riot! was released several weeks after the Twilight soundtrack, capturing the group&apos;s strength as a live act and concluding the long touring cycle in support of Riot! &#xD;&#xA;Paramore publicly struggled with fame throughout 2008. Of particular note was the attention lavished upon Williams, whom many media outlets deemed to be the leader of the group. Rumors of a breakup began to circulate, yet Paramore&apos;s lineup remained intact, and the band retreated to a California studio in 2009 to work on a third album. Following a popular summer tour with No Doubt, the group issued Brand New Eyes, a pensive record that featured some of Paramore&apos;s strongest songwriting to date. The album debuted at number two with sales of 175,000 copies, besting Mariah Carey&apos;s Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel. &#xD;&#xA;Brand New Eyes went gold by the end of the year, and &quot;The Only Exception&quot; became the band&apos;s highest-charting single to date in America. Meanwhile, Williams scored her own chart-topper with &quot;Airplanes,&quot; a multi-platinum collaboration with hip-hop artist B.o.B. Long-simmering tensions between Williams and the Farro brothers had reached a boiling point by late 2010, though, resulting in a messy split between Josh and Zac Farro -- considered by many to be the band&apos;s co-founders -- and the three remaining members. Days after his exit, Josh Farro wrote a blog post detailing the band&apos;s history, including previously unknown details regarding Atlantic&apos;s early involvement and Williams&apos; solo contract. &#xD;&#xA;In 2011, Paramore released the single &quot;Monster,&quot; which was included on the Transformers: Dark of the Moon soundtrack. This was the first song recorded without the Farro brothers and first to feature York taking over all guitar duties. The following year, Paramore began work on new material with producer Justin Meldal-Johnsen (Beck, NIN, Neon Trees, M83) and former Lostprophets drummer Ilan Rubin. In 2013, Paramore returned with their fourth studio album, the eponymously titled Paramore. Including the singles &quot;Now&quot; and &quot;Still into You,&quot; the album featured an expansive stylistic approach that found the group incorporating a variety of sounds from synth pop to gospel. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64444/thumb/1445627388" art="/library/metadata/64444/art/1445627388" addedAt="1438447644" updatedAt="1445627388">

  <Directory ratingKey="61178" key="/library/metadata/61178/children" type="artist" title="Paul Simon" summary="Paul Simon is one of the most successful and respected songwriters of the second half of the 20th century. Rising to fame in the mid-&apos;60s, Simon&apos;s songs were mature and literate, but also melodically engaging, and spoke to the concerns and uncertainties of a generation. As the 1960s gave way to the &apos;70s and &apos;80s, Simon&apos;s work tended to focus on the personal rather than the larger world, but he also expanded his musical palette, and helped introduce many rock and pop fans to world music. &#xD;&#xA;Paul Frederic Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey on October 13, 1941. His father, Louis Simon, was an educator who also led a small jazz combo, while his mother, Belle Simon, taught English; when Paul was a few months old, they moved from Newark to Queens, New York. Paul grew up with a passion for baseball and music, particularly jazz and folk, and as he entered his teens, he developed a taste for the doo wop and R&amp;B sounds that were a staple of Alan Freed&apos;s radio broadcasts, as well as first-generation rockabillies such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins. When Simon was 11 years old, he met Art Garfunkel, and the two became fast friends who discovered they shared an interest in music. Paul and Art formed a harmony duo in the style of their heroes the Everly Brothers, and made their stage debut at a junior-high talent show. By the time they were enrolled at Forest Hills High School, the two were calling themselves Tom &amp; Jerry (Art was Tom Graph, Paul was Jerry Landis), and they filled their spare time playing teen dances and parties. In 1955, the two wrote a song together, &quot;The Girl for Me,&quot; which Simon registered for copyright with the Library of Congress. In 1957, Tom &amp; Jerry were cutting a demo acetate of Simon&apos;s song &quot;Hey Schoolgirl&quot; when the president of a small record company (ironically named Big Records) happened by the studio. The label head liked what he heard, and &quot;Hey Schoolgirl&quot; b/w &quot;Dancin&apos; Wild&quot; was released in the fall of 1957. The record rose to number 52 on the Billboard pop singles charts, and scored Tom &amp; Jerry an appearance on American Bandstand, but while they would cut a number of follow-up releases, &quot;Hey Schoolgirl&quot; was destined to be Tom &amp; Jerry&apos;s only hit. &#xD;&#xA;By March 1958, Simon was already looking toward a solo career, cutting a single, &quot;True or False&quot; b/w &quot;Teen Age Fool,&quot; under the name True Taylor. Jerry Landis also landed his own record deal, releasing his debut single, &quot;Anna Belle&quot; b/w &quot;Loneliness,&quot; in 1959, while Simon also worked with a studio group called the Cosines, who specialized in cutting demos for songwriters. (Another member of the combo was Carole Klein, who would soon enjoy a successful career of her own as Carole King.) By the end of the decade, Paul and Art were both enrolled in college, and Tom &amp; Jerry took a back seat to academics, though Simon would record occasional sessions and wrote songs for others. In 1961, Simon teamed up with a handful of vocalists to form a group called Tico &amp; the Triumphs; the group cut a single, &quot;Motorcycle&quot; b/w &quot;I Don&apos;t Believe Them,&quot; which barely broke into the Billboard singles charts, making Number 99 for one week, but received extensive airplay in Baltimore and became a local hit in the Charm City. &quot;Motorcycle&quot; was released by Amy Records, who soon turned to Simon to write and produce material for several of their artists, including Ritchie Cordell, the Fashions, Dottie Daniels, and Jay Walker &amp; the Pedestrians. Simon also found time to cut another Jerry Landis single, and &quot;The Lone Teen Ranger&quot; spent three weeks on the Billboard charts in early 1963, peaking at number 97. &#xD;&#xA;In the early &apos;60s, the folk revival swept New York City, and a new breed of singers and songwriters introduced a new approach to the craft of creating tunes. Simon, who had been studying English literature, was influenced and encouraged by the new breed of folkies, and in 1963 he re-teamed with Art Garfunkel, this time using their real names and performing the more topical songs Simon was writing. Simon &amp; Garfunkel started playing Greenwich Village folk clubs, and they scored a deal with Columbia Records, releasing their first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 AM, in the fall of 1964. The album was initially a flop, and Simon headed to England, where he made the rounds of folk clubs, recorded some BBC sessions, and even cut a solo album, The Paul Simon Songbook, which was released only in the UK. Simon also co-wrote a few pop tunes with Bruce Woodley of the Seekers, one of which, &quot;Red Rubber Ball,&quot; would become a big hit for the Cyrkle. In late 1965, Tom Wilson, who produced the Wednesday Morning, 3 AM album, learned that one of the songs from the LP, &quot;The Sound of Silence,&quot; was getting scattered radio airplay, and he struck upon the idea of dubbing a rock &amp; roll rhythm section over the acoustic track and issuing it as a single. The strategy worked: the new version of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; was a big hit, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel quickly re-formed, cutting the album Sounds of Silence, which was released in 1966 and spawned the singles &quot;I Am a Rock&quot; and &quot;Kathy&apos;s Song.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;Simon &amp; Garfunkel would enjoy impressive success over the next several years, and were one of the few acts from the early-&apos;60s folk revival that would enjoy success with acoustic-based music during the psychedelic era, thanks in large part to Simon&apos;s songwriting. But while 1970&apos;s Bridge Over Troubled Water was a massive commercial and critical success (and a superb reflection of the end-of-the-decade Zeitgeist of the day), long-simmering creative differences between Simon and Garfunkel came to a head while making the album, and a hiatus from collaborating became a proper breakup when Simon released his self-titled solo album in 1972. Paul Simon featured two hit singles, &quot;Mother and Child Reunion&quot; and &quot;Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,&quot; and found Simon experimenting with reggae and Latin music, as well as polished soft rock. &#xD;&#xA;Released in 1973, There Goes Rhymin&apos; Simon was a more ambitious follow-up, sounding largely optimistic and dipping its toes into gospel and New Orleans jazz as well as R&amp;B-based rock and pop. In 1975, Simon released Still Crazy After All These Years, an album informed by his divorce from his first wife, Peggy Harper. Still Crazy included the song &quot;My Little Town,&quot; which reunited Simon with Art Garfunkel for the first time since Bridge Over Troubled Water. Simon&apos;s next project proved to have a long gestation period; he wrote a screenplay about a musician struggling to save his marriage and his career, and penned a set of songs to accompany it. Simon also starred in the subsequent film, and while One Trick Pony wasn&apos;t his first bit of film acting (he played a small but memorable role in Woody Allen&apos;s Annie Hall), he didn&apos;t fare well alongside a cast of seasoned professionals when the movie debuted in 1980. One Trick Pony&apos;s soundtrack album (his first album for Warner Bros. after a long working relationship with Columbia) spawned the hit single &quot;Late in the Evening,&quot; but otherwise proved to be a disappointment in terms of sales. &#xD;&#xA;In September 1981, Simon &amp; Garfunkel played a massive reunion concert in New York&apos;s Central Park, which led to a brief reunion tour. The Central Park show was released as a live album that was a major commercial success, and the duo made plans to record a new album. But Simon and Garfunkel found themselves at odds in the studio, and Simon&apos;s next album, 1983&apos;s Hearts and Bones, featured no contributions from Garfunkel. The album sold poorly, and by Simon&apos;s own admission he was running short on inspiration when he heard an album of &quot;township jive&quot; by the South African group the Boyoyo Boys. Fascinated by the eclectic blend of creative elements, Simon began creating an album inspired by South African pop, recorded primarily in Johannesburg with a band of South African musicians. The result was 1986&apos;s Graceland, which became an unexpected smash hit, spawning several hits singles, introducing an international audience to South African rhythms, and prompting a renewed dialogue about the nation&apos;s repressive apartheid regime. (The album also generated a certain amount of controversy, as some believed the recording sessions violated a United Nations-led cultural boycott against South Africa; also, several members of the group Los Lobos, who appeared on the album, claimed Simon lifted their melody for the tune &quot;All Around the World, or the Myth of Fingerprints&quot; without giving them songwriting credit.) Simon turned to Brazilian music for inspiration on his next album, 1990&apos;s The Rhythm of the Saints, which also incorporated a number of the South African players who contributed to Graceland. If not as successful as Graceland, The Rhythm of the Saints still fared quite well with fans and critics, and the two albums reestablished Simon as a vital, contemporary artist.&#xD;&#xA;After releasing a live album from the tour in support of The Rhythm of the Saints, Simon retreated to work on another unusual project, a Broadway musical called The Capeman, which was based on the true story of Salvador Agron, a Latino gang member and convicted murderer turned poet and activist. Simon wrote the book for The Capeman in collaboration with Derek Walcott, and composed a set of new songs for the show. However, the production proved difficult and the play, which opened in 1998, received poor reviews and closed after just 68 performances due to slow ticket sales. (A revised version of the show was staged in 2010, and received significantly better notices.) An album of Simon&apos;s interpretations of the show&apos;s songs was issued, but was only a modest success; the original cast recording received a belated digital release in 2006. &#xD;&#xA;Stung by the disappointing response to The Capeman, Simon returned to the studio in 2000 to record You&apos;re the One, an album that suggested a compromise between the African and Latin sounds he&apos;d embraced and the more intimate approach of his early work. Two years later, Simon once again reunited with Art Garfunkel for a concert tour, and a live album, Old Friends: Live on Stage, was released in 2004. Simon returned in 2006 with Surprise, which found him working with an unlikely producer, Brian Eno. Released in 2011, So Beautiful or So What captured Simon returning to a more organic songwriting style than he&apos;d employed since Graceland, though the tenor of the lyrics confirmed he was still keenly aware of the sounds and ideas of the present day. The album was also his first release for Hear Music; the same label released 2012&apos;s Live in New York City, taken from a special intimate hometown concert from the tour in support of So Beautiful. ~ Mark Deming" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61178/thumb/1445625551" art="/library/metadata/61178/art/1445625551" addedAt="1438458213" updatedAt="1445625551">

  <Directory ratingKey="61077" key="/library/metadata/61077/children" type="artist" title="Peter Gabriel" summary="As the leader of Genesis in the early &apos;70s, Peter Gabriel helped move progressive rock to new levels of theatricality. He was no less ambitious as a solo artist, but he was more subtle in his methods. With his first eponymous solo album in 1977, he began exploring darker, more cerebral territory, incorporating avant-garde, electronic, and worldbeat influences into his music. The record, as well as its two similarly titled successors, established Gabriel as a critically acclaimed cult artist, and with 1982&apos;s Security, he began to move into the mainstream; &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; became his first Top 40 hit, paving the way for his multi-platinum breakthrough So in 1986. Accompanied by a series of groundbreaking videos and the number one single &quot;Sledgehammer,&quot; So became a multi-platinum hit, and Gabriel became an international star. Instead of capitalizing on his sudden success, he began to explore other interests, including recording soundtracks and running his company Real World. By the time he returned to pop with 1992&apos;s Us, his mass audience had faded away and he spent the remainder of the &apos;90s working on multimedia projects for Real World.&#xD;&#xA;Following his departure from Genesis in 1976, Peter Gabriel began work on the first of three consecutive eponymously titled albums; each record was named Peter Gabriel, he said, as if they were editions of the same magazine. In 1977, his first solo album appeared and became a moderate success due to the single &quot;Solsbury Hill.&quot; Another self-titled record followed in 1978, yet received comparatively weaker reviews. Gabriel&apos;s third eponymous album proved to be his artistic breakthrough, however. Produced by Steve Lillywhite and released in 1980, the album established Gabriel as one of rock&apos;s most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political -- &quot;Biko,&quot; a song about a murdered anti-apartheid activist, became one of the biggest protest anthems of the &apos;80s. &quot;Games Without Frontiers,&quot; with its eerie chorus, nearly reached the Top 40. &#xD;&#xA;In 1982, Gabriel released Security, which was an even bigger success, earning positive reviews and going gold on the strength of the startling video for &quot;Shock the Monkey.&quot; Just as his solo career was taking off, Gabriel participated in a one-shot Genesis reunion in order to finance his WOMAD -- World of Music, Arts and Dance -- Festival. WOMAD was designed to bring various world musics and customs to a Western audience, and it soon turned into an annual event, and a live double album was released that year to commemorate the event. As Gabriel worked on his fifth album, he contributed the soundtrack to Alan Parker&apos;s 1984 film Birdy. His score was highly praised and it won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes that year. After founding Real World, Inc. -- a corporation devoted to developing bridges between technology and multi-ethnic arts -- in 1985, he completed his fifth album, So.&#xD;&#xA;Released in 1986, So became Gabriel&apos;s commercial breakthrough, largely because his Stax homage &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; was blessed with an innovative video that combined stop-action animation with live action. So climbed to number two as &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; hit number one, with &quot;Big Time&quot; -- featuring a video very similar to &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; -- reaching the Top Ten and &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; hitting the Top 30. As So was riding high on the American and British charts, Gabriel co-headlined the first benefit tour for Amnesty International in 1986 with Sting and U2. Another Amnesty International Tour followed in 1988, and the following year, Gabriel released Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ, a collection of instrumentals used in Martin Scorsese&apos;s film. Passion was the furthest Gabriel delved into worldbeat, and the album was widely acclaimed, winning the Grammy Award in 1989 for Best New Age Performance. In 1990, he released the hits compilation Shaking the Tree.&#xD;&#xA;Gabriel labored long on the pop music follow-up to So, finally releasing Us in the spring of 1992. During the recording of Us, Gabriel went through a number of personal upheavals, including a painful divorce, and those tensions manifested themselves on Us, a much darker record than So. For various reasons, not the least of which was the fact that it was released six years after its predecessor, Us wasn&apos;t as commercially successful as So, despite positive reviews. Only one single, the &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; knockoff &quot;Steam,&quot; reached the Top 40, and the album stalled at platinum sales. In 1993, Gabriel embarked on the most ambitious WOMAD tour to date, touring the United States with a roster including Crowded House, James, and SinÃ©ad O&apos;Connor, with whom he had an on-off romantic relationship. The following year, he released the double-disc Secret World Live, which went gold. Later in 1994, he released the CD-ROM Xplora, one of many projects he developed with Real World. For the rest of the decade, Gabriel concentrated on developing more multimedia projects for the company and working on a new studio album. &#xD;&#xA;Up was released in 2002, a full decade after Gabriel&apos;s last studio effort. Dense, cerebral, and often difficult, the record peaked at number nine but failed to sell well in America. It fared slightly better in Canada, where it went gold. He then turned his attention to a host of different projects, although the release of Big Blue Ball -- a compilation of collaborative performances recorded at Real World Studios during the &apos;90s -- helped placate fans while Gabriel focused his energies elsewhere. He eventually returned to the studio for another album, 2010&apos;s Scratch My Back, which featured orchestral covers of songs originally performed by Radiohead, Arcade Fire, Paul Simon, David Bowie, and others. Gabriel uncharacteristically delivered the sequel to Scratch My Back quickly, releasing New Blood -- a collection of orchestral reinterpretations of his own songs -- in the fall of 2011. The following year, Gabriel held a lavish celebration of the 25th anniversary of So, releasing several deluxe editions of the record -- the largest being a four-CD, two-DVD, two-vinyl box -- and launching the Back to Front tour, where he played So in its entirety. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" viewCount="1" lastViewedAt="1445628882" thumb="/library/metadata/61077/thumb/1445625538" art="/library/metadata/61077/art/1445625538" addedAt="1438448698" updatedAt="1445625538">

  <Directory ratingKey="64423" key="/library/metadata/64423/children" type="artist" title="Phoenix" summary="The French group Phoenix draw elements from their eclectic &apos;80s upbringing to arrive at a satisfying blend of rock and synthesizers. Vocalist Thomas Mars, bassist Deck d&apos;Arcy, and guitarist Christian Mazzalai were a garage band based out of Mars&apos; house in the suburbs of Paris. Mazzalai&apos;s older brother Branco joined the band on guitar when his band Darlin&apos; disbanded in 1995.&#xD;&#xA;The group got its touring start on the French bar circuit doing Hank Williams and Prince covers to drunken audiences. Two years later the band took on the name Phoenix and pressed 500 copies of a single on its own label, Ghettoblaster. The A-side was a punk rock song and the other a chugging Krautrocker, hinting at their eclectic tastes. Shortly after, they were signed to the Paris-based Source Records. Phoenix became well acquainted with labelmates Air when they acted as their backing band on several U.K. TV appearances. The result of the electronic exposure was a single called &quot;Heatwave,&quot; which was very similar in approach to &apos;70s disco. &#xD;&#xA;United, the group&apos;s debut album, appeared in 2000 on Astralwerks and was recorded over two months. The album featured guest appearances from friends and family, including Thomas Bangalter (Daft Punk), Philippe Zdar (Cassius), and d&apos;Arcy&apos;s mother&apos;s choral society on the track &quot;Funky Squaredance.&quot; From that point, they issued Alphabetical (2004), It&apos;s Never Been Like That (2006), and their mainstream breakthrough, the critically adored Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (2009). Part of the extended break between the third and fourth albums was due to Mars becoming a father (with his partner, director Sofia Coppola). Soon after finishing the Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix tour, the band reconvened in Adam Yauch&apos;s studio Oscilloscope Laboratories in late 2010 and embarked on some experimental recording sessions. They continued in Paris the following year and completed recording in 2012 with the help of co-producer Phillipe Zdar, then mixed the songs on the console used to mix Michael Jackson&apos;s Thriller, which the band bought on eBay for $17,000. The results, Bankrupt!, appeared in April 2013, near the time of the band&apos;s headlining gig at the Coachella Festival. ~ Diana Potts" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64423/thumb/1445627324" art="/library/metadata/64423/art/1445627324" addedAt="1438447683" updatedAt="1445627324">

  <Directory ratingKey="64385" key="/library/metadata/64385/children" type="artist" title="Porcupine Tree" summary="Though he initially came to wider attention (at least in the U.K.) with No-Man, his long-running collaboration with Tim Bowness throughout the &apos;90s, singer/guitarist Steven Wilson gained as much of a reputation for Porcupine Tree. Embracing and exploring prog rock inspirations while always keeping an ear out for newer musical connections, thus sidestepping the pointless revivalism of many of the band&apos;s peers, Porcupine Tree has created some noteworthy albums and songs over the years, continuing full-strength into the new millennium.&#xD;&#xA;The group itself was just Wilson at the start. Born in London in 1967, he was too young to participate in the first full flush of psychedelic and experimental rock music, but swiftly made up for lost time, turning out to be a talented musical prodigy. Having learned guitar and keyboards at a young age, he contributed to work by underground prog outfits of the early &apos;80s such as Altamont and Karma, while continuing his own musical growth and exploration. 1987 saw the founding of both No-Man and Porcupine Tree, the latter actually starting as a joke between Wilson and a friend about a legendary lost &apos;70s group. Elaborate discographies and other material were created Ã  la Spinal Tap, while Wilson himself created a slew of music meant to be the band&apos;s lost recordings. In a humorous twist of fate, two tapes of this material ended up in the hands of other folks interested in hearing more from Wilson, who ended up collating the best tracks for Porcupine Tree&apos;s real debut album on Delerium Records, On the Sunday of Life, in 1992. Those songs having been something of a nostalgia exercise, Wilson aimed for a more contemporary approach on his follow-up release -- the extended single &quot;Voyage 34,&quot; with a clear debt to ambient techno jokesters the Orb.&#xD;&#xA;Up the Downstair, Porcupine Tree&apos;s next full album, found Wilson coming fully into his own, creating a majestic, sweeping album that took the prog inspirations of the past fully into a realm of mysterious hush and beauty as much as full-on rock charge. Two collaborators on other projects, bassist Colin Edwin and keyboardist Richard Barbieri, the latter one of the core members of early-&apos;80s pop art geniuses Japan, guested on the album. Later that year, the two formally joined Porcupine Tree, along with drummer Chris Maitland, establishing a four-piece lineup.&#xD;&#xA;The first release by the new version of the group, The Sky Moves Sideways, was actually something of a transitional affair, a number of the songs still being Wilson solo compositions and performances. A slew of fine songs stood out regardless, notably &quot;Moonloop,&quot; but the bandmembers themselves considered the quartet&apos;s true debut to be 1996&apos;s Signify, another stunning step forward for the Porcupine Tree sound, with new highlights everywhere, including the epic blast of the title track itself. A nice nod to the past came that year with the vinyl-only Spiral Circus album, featuring selections from the first three performances of the four-piece lineup in 1993, while 1997&apos;s Coma Divine featured live recordings from the Rome stop on the Signify tour. By this time, Porcupine Tree&apos;s reputation had spread throughout Europe and elsewhere, including an increasing cult following in America.&#xD;&#xA;A friendly parting from Delerium led Porcupine Tree to Snapper/K-Scope, which released 1999&apos;s Stupid Dream, notable for its stronger song focus and slightly more accessible feel all around. The band&apos;s reputation and fan base continued to grow, with another album, Lightbulb Sun, taking its bow in 2000. Porcupine Tree continued to tour and plan ahead for both new recordings and reissues of older, rarer material, the first of which surfaced in May 2001, titled Recordings. Various unreleased cuts from the Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun sessions as well as a few B-sides were included. They spent the rest of the year putting together Stars Die: The Delerium Years &apos;91-97, a box set that looks at their catalog from 1991 to 1997. Many more unreleased and rare tracks found their way onto the set, and the album finally came out in late autumn 2001. Drummer Chris Maitland left the band in March of 2002, but luckily, Gavin Harrison was available to take his place. A year later, In Absentia was released, followed by Warszawa and Deadwing in 2005. Up the Downstair was reissued that same year, complete with a bonus disc of the band&apos;s 1994 EP Staircase Infinities. Porcupine Tree did some sporadic touring in summer 2006 before fall dates were completed around the U.K., Europe, and the United States. Around the same time, Stupid Dream was reissued with bonus material. In 2007, the band released their ninth studio LP, a loose concept album with an underlying theme of escapism in the 21st century, aptly named Fear of a Blank Planet (not to be confused with the similarly titled Public Enemy classic). The following year, the band released the mini-album Nil Recurring, which consisted of tracks written during the recording of Fear of a Blank Planet. In 2009, the group released Incident, which was comprised of a single long song that featured many different movements, as well as a handful of shorter compositions that close the album. The double-live album, Octane Twisted, followed in 2012. ~ Ned Raggett" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64385/thumb/1445627238" art="/library/metadata/64385/art/1445627238" addedAt="1438447706" updatedAt="1445627238">

  <Directory ratingKey="64377" key="/library/metadata/64377/children" type="artist" title="Pretty Lights" summary="Flitting between moody downtempo and upbeat, densely layered material geared for club play, Colorado&apos;s Pretty Lights was the project of Derek Vincent Smith. Smith spent his high school years making hip-hop and ultimately dropped out of his freshman year at the University of Colorado at Boulder to focus on his music. He made his recorded debut as Pretty Lights in 2006 with the full-length Taking Up Your Precious Time, which he supported with gigs for acts including STS9, the Disco Biscuits, and Widespread Panic. From there, he kept up a busy release schedule for the rest of the 2000s, issuing the double album Filling Up the City Skies in 2008 and another full-length, Passing by Behind Your Eyes, the following year. In 2010, Pretty Lights went on an extensive North American tour, playing that year&apos;s Coachella, Ultra, Movement, and Electric Zoo festivals, among other stops. Smith continued touring into 2011 and also developed his Pretty Lights Music imprint, releasing albums by Michal Menert, Gramatik, and Eliot Lipp. In 2012, Smith appeared in the music documentary Re:GENERATION Music Project and began work on Pretty Lights&apos; fourth album. Instead of sampling existing recordings, Smith worked with longtime drummer Adam Deitch, Soulive&apos;s Eric Krasno, the Harlem Gospel Choir, and members of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and the Treme Brass Band to create vintage-sounding original music that he then refashioned into the Pretty Lights sound. The results were 2013&apos;s A Color Map of the Sun, which became the first Pretty Lights album to be released physically and digitally at the same time. ~ Heather Phares &amp; Andy Kellman" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64377/thumb/1445627217" art="/library/metadata/64377/art/1445627217" addedAt="1438447754" updatedAt="1445627217">

  <Directory ratingKey="64347" key="/library/metadata/64347/children" type="artist" title="Prince" summary="Few artists have created a body of work as rich and varied as Prince. During the &apos;80s, he emerged as one of the most singular talents of the rock &amp; roll era, capable of seamlessly tying together pop, funk, folk, and rock. Not only did he release a series of groundbreaking albums; he toured frequently, produced albums and wrote songs for many other artists, and recorded hundreds of songs that still lie unreleased in his vaults. With each album he released, Prince has shown remarkable stylistic growth and musical diversity, constantly experimenting with different sounds, textures, and genres. Occasionally, his music can be maddeningly inconsistent because of this eclecticism, but his experiments frequently succeed; no other contemporary artist can blend so many diverse styles into a cohesive whole.&#xD;&#xA;Prince&apos;s first two albums were solid, if unremarkable, late-&apos;70s funk-pop. With 1980&apos;s Dirty Mind, he recorded his first masterpiece, a one-man tour de force of sex and music; it was hard funk, catchy Beatlesque melodies, sweet soul ballads, and rocking guitar pop, all at once. The follow-up, Controversy, was more of the same, but 1999 was brilliant. The album was a monster hit, selling over three million copies, but it was nothing compared to 1984&apos;s Purple Rain.&#xD;&#xA;Purple Rain made Prince a superstar; it eventually sold over ten million copies in the U.S. and spent 24 weeks at number one. Partially recorded with his touring band, the Revolution, the record featured the most pop-oriented music he has ever made. Instead of continuing in this accessible direction, he veered off into the bizarre psycho-psychedelia of Around the World in a Day, which nevertheless sold over two million copies. In 1986, he released the even stranger Parade, which was in its own way as ambitious and intricate as any art rock of the &apos;60s; however, no art rock was ever grounded with a hit as brilliant as the spare funk of &quot;Kiss.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;By 1987, Prince&apos;s ambitions were growing by leaps and bounds, resulting in the sprawling masterpiece Sign &apos;O&apos; the Times. Prince was set to release the hard funk of The Black Album by the end of the year, yet he withdrew it just before its release, deciding it was too dark and immoral. Instead, he released the confused Lovesexy in 1988, which was a commercial disaster. With the soundtrack to 1989&apos;s Batman he returned to the top of the charts, even if the album was essentially a recap of everything he had done before. The following year he released Graffiti Bridge (the sequel to Purple Rain), which turned out to be a considerable commercial disappointment.&#xD;&#xA;In 1991, Prince formed the New Power Generation, the best and most versatile and talented band he has ever assembled. With their first album, Diamonds and Pearls, Prince reasserted his mastery of contemporary R&amp;B; it was his biggest hit since 1985. The following year, he released his 12th album, which was titled with a cryptic symbol; in 1993, Prince legally changed his name to the symbol. In 1994, after becoming embroiled in contract disagreements with Warner Bros., he independently released the single &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,&quot; likely to illustrate what he would be capable of on his own; the song became his biggest hit in years. Later that summer, Warner released the somewhat halfhearted Come under the name of Prince; the record was a moderate success, going gold.&#xD;&#xA;In November 1994, as part of a contractual obligation, Prince agreed to the official release of The Black Album. In early 1995, he immersed himself in another legal battle with Warner, proclaiming himself a slave and refusing to deliver his new record, The Gold Experience, for release. By the end of the summer, a fed-up Warner had negotiated a compromise that guaranteed the album&apos;s release, plus one final record for the label. The Gold Experience was issued in the fall; although it received good reviews and was following a smash single, it failed to catch fire commercially. In the summer of 1996, Prince released Chaos &amp; Disorder, which freed him to become an independent artist. Setting up his own label, NPG (which was distributed by EMI), he resurfaced later that same year with the three-disc Emancipation, which was designed as a magnum opus that would spin off singles for several years and be supported with several tours. &#xD;&#xA;However, even his devoted cult following needed considerable time to digest such an enormous compilation of songs. Once it was clear that Emancipation wasn&apos;t the commercial blockbuster he hoped it would be, Prince assembled a long-awaited collection of outtakes and unreleased material called Crystal Ball in 1998. With Crystal Ball, Prince discovered that it&apos;s much more difficult to get records to an audience than it seems; some fans who pre-ordered their copies through Prince&apos;s website (from which a bonus fifth disc was included) didn&apos;t receive them until months after the set began appearing in stores. Prince then released a new one-man album, New Power Soul, just three months after Crystal Ball; even though it was his most straightforward album since Diamonds and Pearls, it didn&apos;t do well on the charts, partly because many listeners didn&apos;t realize it had been released.&#xD;&#xA;A year later, with &quot;1999&quot; predictably an end-of-the-millennium anthem, Prince issued the remix collection 1999 (The New Master). A collection of Warner Bros.-era leftovers, Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale, followed that summer, and in the fall Prince returned on Arista with the all-star Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic. In the fall of 2001 he released the controversial Rainbow Children, a jazz-infused circus of sound trumpeting his conversion to the Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses that left many longtime fans out in the cold. He further isolated himself with 2003&apos;s N.E.W.S., a four-song set of instrumental jams that sounded a lot more fun to play than to listen to. Prince rebounded in 2003 with the chart-topping Musicology, a return to form that found the artist back in the Top Ten, even garnering a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 2005. &#xD;&#xA;In early 2006 he was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live, performing two songs with a new protÃ©gÃ©e, R&amp;B singer Tamar. A four-song appearance at the Brit Awards with Wendy, Lisa, and Sheila E. followed. Both appearances previewed tracks from 3121, which hit number one on the album charts soon after its release in March 2006. Planet Earth followed in 2007, featuring contributions from Wendy and Lisa. In the U.K., copies were cover-mounted on the July 15 edition of The Mail on Sunday, provoking Columbia -- the worldwide distributor for the release -- to refuse distribution throughout the U.K. In the U.S., the album was issued on July 24. LotusFlow3r, a three-disc set, came in 2009, featuring a trio of distinct albums: LotusFlow3r itself (a guitar showcase), MPLSound (a throwback to his &apos;80s funk output), and Elixer (a smooth contemporary R&amp;B album featuring the breathy vocals of Bria Valente). Despite only being available online and through one big-box retailer, the set debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. A year later, another throwback-flavored effort, 20Ten, became his second U.K. newspaper giveaway. No official online edition of the album was made available. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64347/thumb/1445627339" art="/library/metadata/64347/art/1445627339" addedAt="1438447762" updatedAt="1445627339">

  <Directory ratingKey="61065" key="/library/metadata/61065/children" type="artist" title="The Prodigy" titleSort="Prodigy" summary="The Prodigy navigated the high wire, balancing artistic merit and mainstream visibility with more flair than any electronica act of the 1990s. Ably defeating the image-unconscious attitude of most electronic artists in favor of a focus on nominal frontman Keith Flint, the group crossed over to the mainstream of pop music with an incendiary live experience that approximated the original atmosphere of the British rave scene even while leaning uncomfortably close to arena rock showmanship and punk theatrics. True, Flint&apos;s spiky hairstyle and numerous piercings often made for better advertising, but it was producer Liam Howlett whose studio wizardry launched the Prodigy to the top of the charts, spinning a web of hard-hitting breakbeat techno with king-sized hooks and unmissable samples. &#xD;&#xA;Despite electronic music&apos;s diversity and quick progression during the 1990s -- from rave/hardcore to ambient/downtempo and back again, thanks to the breakbeat/drum&apos;n&apos;bass movement -- Howlett modified the Prodigy&apos;s sound only sparingly; swapping the rave-whistle effects and ragga samples for metal chords and chanted vocals proved the only major difference in the band&apos;s evolution from its debut to its worldwide breakthrough with third album The Fat of the Land. Even before the band took its place as the premiere dance act for the alternative masses, the Prodigy had proved a consistent entry in the British charts, with over a dozen consecutive singles in the Top 20.&#xD;&#xA;Howlett, the prodigy behind the group&apos;s name, was trained on the piano while growing up in Braintree, Essex. He began listening to hip-hop in the mid-&apos;80s and later DJ&apos;ed with the British rap act Cut to Kill before moving on to acid house later in the decade. The fledgling hardcore breakbeat sound was perfect for an old hip-hop fan fluent in uptempo dance music, and Howlett began producing tracks in his bedroom studio during 1988. His first release, the EP What Evil Lurks, became a major mover on the fledgling rave scene in 1990. After Howlett met up with Keith Flint and Leeroy Thornhill (both Essex natives as well) in the growing British rave scene, the trio formed the Prodigy later that year. Howlett&apos;s recordings gained the trio a contract with XL Records, which re-released What Evil Lurks in February 1991.&#xD;&#xA;Six months later, Howlett issued his second single, &quot;Charly,&quot; built around a sample from a children&apos;s public service announcement. It hit number one on the British dance charts, then crossed over to the pop charts, stalling only at number three. (It wasn&apos;t long before a copycat craze saw the launch of rave takeoffs on Speed Racer, The Magic Roundabout, and Sesame Street.) Two additional Prodigy singles, &quot;Everybody in the Place&quot; and &quot;Fire/Jericho,&quot; charted in the U.K. during late 1991 and early 1992.&#xD;&#xA;The Prodigy showed they were no one-anthem wonders in late 1992, with the release of The Prodigy Experience, one of the first LPs by a rave act. Mixing chunky breakbeats with vocal samples from dub legend Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and the Crazy World of Arthur Brown, it hit the Top Ten and easily went gold. During 1993, Howlett added a ragga/hip-hop MC named Maxim Reality (Keeti Palmer) and occupied himself with remix work for Front 242, Jesus Jones, and Art of Noise. He also released the white-label single &quot;Earthbound&quot; to fool image-conscious DJs who had written off the Prodigy as hopelessly commercial. Late 1993 brought the commercial release of &quot;Earthbound&quot; (as the group&apos;s seventh consecutive Top 20 singles entry, &quot;One Love&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;After several months of working on tracks, Howlett issued the next Prodigy single, &quot;No Good (Start the Dance).&quot; Despite the fact that the single&apos;s hook was a sped-up diva-vocal tag (an early rave staple), the following album, Music for the Jilted Generation, provided a transition for the group, from piano pieces and rave-signal tracks to more guitar-integrated singles like &quot;Voodoo People.&quot; The album also continued the Prodigy&apos;s allegiance to breakbeat drum&apos;n&apos;bass; though the style had only recently become commercially viable (after a long gestation period in the dance underground), Howlett had been incorporating it from the beginning of his career. Music for the Jilted Generation entered the British charts at number one and went gold in its first week of release. The album was also nominated for a Mercury Music Prize, as one of the best albums of the year.&#xD;&#xA;The Prodigy spent much of 1994 and 1995 touring around the world, and made a splashy appearance at the 1995 Glastonbury Festival, proving that electronica could make it in a live venue. The group had already made a transition from the club/rave circuit to more traditional rock venues, and the Glastonbury show set in stone the fact that they were no longer just a dance group. Flint&apos;s newly emerged persona -- the consummate in-your-face punk showman and master of ceremonies for the digital-age crowd -- provided a point of reference for rock critics uncomfortable covering Howlett (whom they saw as a glorified keyboard player).&#xD;&#xA;The Prodigy&apos;s incessant road schedule left little time to record, but Howlett managed to bring out the next new Prodigy single in March 1996. &quot;Firestarter&quot; entered the British charts at number one, though the video was almost banned due to complaints about arson fixation; many Top of the Pops viewers also complained that Keith Flint had scared their children. An unmissable guitar hook and Flint&apos;s catcall vocal antics -- his first on record -- made it a quick worldwide hit, and though &quot;Firestarter&quot; wasn&apos;t a major success in the U.S., its high-profile spot in MTV&apos;s Buzz Bin introduced the Prodigy to many Americans and helped fuel the major-label push for electronica during the following year (though the Prodigy did reject collaborative offers from David Bowie, U2, and Madonna). In the middle of the electronica buzz, the Prodigy dropped their third album, The Fat of the Land. Despite rather obvious attempts to court mainstream rock fans (including several guest vocalist spots and an L7 cover), the LP entered both British and American charts at number one, shifting several million units worldwide. The next Prodigy full-length was 1999&apos;s The Dirtchamber Sessions, a mix album helmed by Howlett. &#xD;&#xA;The &quot;Baby&apos;s Got a Temper&quot; single -- one Howlett would later disown -- appeared in 2002, and soon after Leeroy Thornhill left the band. Maxim and Keith Flint were still in the band but they weren&apos;t to be found on 2004&apos;s Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned. Instead, the album featured guest spots from Oasis&apos; Liam Gallagher, Kool Keith, Twista, and actress Juliette Lewis. Flint and Maxim did join Howlett for a worldwide tour to support the album that launched in October 2004. Five years later, Invaders Must Die signaled a return to the rave sound of their debut, and also found both Flint and Maxim back as core members. The lead single &quot;Omen&quot; reached number three on the British charts prior to the album&apos;s release, and Invaders Must Die debuted at the top spot on the British album charts. The live album World&apos;s on Fire followed, recorded in 2010 at the Prodigy&apos;s own Warrior&apos;s Dance festival. ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61065/thumb/1445625547" art="/library/metadata/61065/art/1445625547" addedAt="1438450307" updatedAt="1445625547">

  <Directory ratingKey="61038" key="/library/metadata/61038/children" type="artist" title="R. Kelly" summary="R&amp;B producer/vocalist/multi-instrumentalist/songwriter R. Kelly and his supporting band Public Announcement began recording in 1992 at the tail-end of the new jack swing era, yet he was able to keep much of its sound alive while remaining commercially successful. While he created a smooth, professional mixture of hip-hop beats, soul-man crooning, and funk, the most distinctive element of Kelly&apos;s music is its explicit carnality. He was able to make songs like &quot;Sex Me,&quot; &quot;Bump n&apos; Grind,&quot; &quot;Your Body&apos;s Callin&apos;,&quot; and &quot;Feelin&apos; on Yo Booty&quot; into hits because his production was seductive enough to sell such blatant come-ons. As his crossover success broadened, Kelly also developed a flair for pop balladry that helped cement his status as one of the biggest-selling male artists of the &apos;90s and 2000s.&#xD;&#xA;Kelly and Public Announcement released their debut album, Born into the 90&apos;s, at the beginning of 1992. It was an instant R&amp;B smash, while earning a fair amount of pop airplay; &quot;Honey Love&quot; and &quot;Slow Dance (Hey Mr. DJ)&quot; were number one R&amp;B hits, while &quot;Dedicated&quot; was his biggest pop hit at number 31. 12 Play, released in the fall of 1993, established Kelly as an R&amp;B superstar, eventually selling over five million copies. The first single, &quot;Sex Me, Pts. 1-2,&quot; went gold, and the second, &quot;Bump n&apos; Grind,&quot; hit number one on both the pop and R&amp;B charts in 1994; it stayed on top of the R&amp;B charts for an astonishing 12 weeks, while logging four weeks at number one on the pop charts. The follow-up, &quot;Your Body&apos;s Callin&apos;,&quot; was another gold single, peaking at number 13 pop.&#xD;&#xA;Also in 1994, he produced Age Ain&apos;t Nothing But a Number, the hit debut album for then-15-year-old Detroit R&amp;B singer Aaliyah. Late in the year, it was revealed that Kelly and Aaliyah had wed in August and gotten an annulment shortly thereafter. The news sparked a small storm of controversy in the media, yet it didn&apos;t hurt the careers of either singer. Kelly next wrote and co-produced &quot;You Are Not Alone,&quot; the second single from Michael Jackson&apos;s HIStory album, which was released in the summer of 1995. Later that year, Kelly released a self-titled album that became his first to top the pop charts. R. Kelly sold four million copies and produced three platinum singles -- &quot;You Remind Me of Something,&quot; &quot;Down Low (Nobody Has to Know),&quot; and &quot;I Can&apos;t Sleep Baby (If I)&quot; -- all of which hit number one R&amp;B and reached the pop Top Ten. &#xD;&#xA;Kelly truly consolidated his crossover success with the 1996 single &quot;I Believe I Can Fly,&quot; which he recorded for the Michael Jordan movie Space Jam. Transcending Kelly&apos;s prior sexed-up image, the song reached number two on the pop charts and won Grammy Awards for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Best R&amp;B Song, and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. Kelly remained in the public eye in 1997 with another Top Ten soundtrack tune, Batman &amp; Robin&apos;s &quot;Gotham City.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;The ambitious two-disc R. followed in 1998, and even though it downplayed the explicit loverman routine that had made him a star, it became Kelly&apos;s biggest-selling album yet, going platinum seven times over. Its first single, a duet with Celine Dion titled &quot;I&apos;m Your Angel,&quot; became Kelly&apos;s second number one pop hit with a six-week run on top. Even though subsequent singles &quot;When a Woman&apos;s Fed Up&quot; and &quot;If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time&quot; were more successful on the R&amp;B charts, Kelly was well on his way to landing more Top 40 hits in the &apos;90s than any other male solo artist, and notched another with his guest appearance on Puff Daddy&apos;s R&amp;B chart-topper &quot;Satisfy You.&quot; Moving his blockbuster success into a new decade, Kelly returned in 2000 with TP-2.com, which spent three weeks at number one on the album charts and scaled back the ambition of R. to return to familiar lyrical themes. He scored two more R&amp;B number ones with &quot;I Wish&quot; and &quot;Fiesta&quot; (the latter featuring guest Jay-Z), and had further hits with &quot;Feelin&apos; on Yo Booty&quot; and &quot;The World&apos;s Greatest,&quot; the latter from the soundtrack of the Will Smith film Ali.&#xD;&#xA;In the wake of &quot;Fiesta,&quot; Kelly and Jay-Z teamed up to record an entire album together. The Best of Both Worlds was heavily hyped and even more heavily bootlegged, but problems of a much more serious nature arose in February 2002, when The Chicago Sun-Times reported that it had been given a videotape showing Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. When the scandal broke, other reports surfaced that Kelly had settled a civil suit in 1998 involving a sexual relationship with a then-underage girl, and that he was in the process of settling another suit brought by an Epic Records intern making similar allegations. Copies of the tape in question were sold as bootlegs and on the Internet, and while there was some question as to whether the man was really Kelly, and whether the girl really was underage, Kelly&apos;s past history seemed to lend credence to the charge. Some radio stations dropped him from their playlists, and anti-Kelly protests were staged in Chicago. Meanwhile, The Best of Both Worlds entered the charts at number two, but sold disappointingly; some blamed the scandal, others the extensive pre-release bootlegging, although the generally unfavorable reviews suggested that the record&apos;s overall quality might also have been to blame. &#xD;&#xA;Following the initial sex-tape scandal, Kelly was dogged by numerous civil suits, including one from a girl who alleged that during her relationship with Kelly (which occurred while she was underage), she had become pregnant and gotten an abortion at the singer&apos;s urging. A variety of other sex videos purporting to feature Kelly appeared as bootlegs, and a one-time Kelly protÃ©gÃ©e, a singer called Sparkle, stepped forward to identify the girl on the original tape as her then-14-year-old niece. In June, Chicago police officially charged Kelly with 21 counts of child pornography-related offenses, all related to the original tape. Kelly pleaded not guilty and released a new song, &quot;Heaven, I Need a Hug,&quot; which got extensive airplay for a brief period. &#xD;&#xA;Meanwhile, work on his next album, Loveland, stalled amid more heavy bootlegging. Kelly eventually scrapped some of the most pirated tracks, recorded some new songs, and reassembled the album as Chocolate Factory (which was slated to include a bonus disc with some of the deleted material). Released in advance of the album, lead single &quot;Ignition&quot; shot to number one on the R&amp;B charts in late 2002. Chocolate Factory itself was released in early 2003, and was followed in 2004 by Happy People/U Saved Me. Surprisingly, despite reports of a feud with Jay-Z, later in 2004 another album was released from The Best of Both Worlds sessions.&#xD;&#xA;Weeks before the scheduled start date of his child pornography trial in 2005, TP.3 Reloaded was released, featuring the first five chapters of his soapy &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot; saga. The relatively uneventful eighth and ninth studio albums Double Up (2007) and Untitled (2009) followed. In the meantime, the much-delayed trial finally took place (in 2008) and Kelly walked free, having been found not guilty on all counts. In 2010, Kelly&apos;s activity included Epic -- a European release combining some of his widescreen hits with a handful of new &quot;inspirational&quot; songs, including &quot;Sign of a Victory,&quot; the anthem he recorded for the opening ceremony of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The second release was the world-wide studio album Love Letter, a classy and retro-minded affair issued only a couple months later. After undergoing emergency throat surgery in July 2011, Kelly returned in June of 2012 with a memoir written with David Ritz -- Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me -- as well as Write Me Back, his twelfth studio album. Just over a year later, he had another new album ready to go. Black Panties, slated for release in December 2013, saw him ditching the retro influence of Love Letter and Write Me Back for a record which combined the raw, explicit sexuality of his early releases with a contemporary technological twist. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Steve Huey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61038/thumb/1445625499" art="/library/metadata/61038/art/1445625499" addedAt="1438451895" updatedAt="1445625499">

  <Directory ratingKey="61024" key="/library/metadata/61024/children" type="artist" title="R.E.M." summary="R.E.M. marked the point when post-punk turned into alternative rock. When their first single, &quot;Radio Free Europe,&quot; was released in 1981, it sparked a back-to-the-garage movement in the American underground. While there were a number of hardcore and punk bands in the U.S. during the early &apos;80s, R.E.M. brought guitar pop back into the underground lexicon. Combining ringing guitar hooks with mumbled, cryptic lyrics and a D.I.Y. aesthetic borrowed from post-punk, the band simultaneously sounded traditional and modern. Though there were no overt innovations in their music, R.E.M. had an identity and sense of purpose that transformed the American underground. Throughout the &apos;80s, they worked relentlessly, releasing records every year and touring constantly, playing both theaters and backwoods dives. Along the way, they inspired countless bands, from the legions of jangle pop groups in the mid-&apos;80s to scores of alternative pop groups in the &apos;90s, who admired their slow climb to stardom. &#xD;&#xA;It did take R.E.M. several years to break into the top of the charts, but they had a cult following the release of their debut EP, Chronic Town, in 1982. Chronic Town established the haunting folk and garage rock that became the band&apos;s signature sound, and over the next five years, they continued to expand their music with a series of critically acclaimed albums. By the late &apos;80s, the group&apos;s fan base had grown large enough to guarantee strong sales, but the Top Ten success in 1987 of Document and &quot;The One I Love&quot; was unexpected, especially since R.E.M. had only altered their sound slightly. Following Document, R.E.M. slowly became one of the world&apos;s most popular bands. After an exhaustive international tour supporting 1988&apos;s Green, the band retired from touring for six years and retreated into the studio to produce their most popular records, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992). By the time they returned to performing with the Monster tour in 1995, the band had been acknowledged by critics and musicians as one of the forefathers of the thriving alternative rock movement, and they were rewarded with the most lucrative tour of their career. Toward the late &apos;90s, R.E.M. was an institution, as its influence was felt in new generations of bands. &#xD;&#xA;Though R.E.M. formed in Athens, Georgia, in 1980, Mike Mills (born December 17, 1958) and Bill Berry (born July 31, 1958) were the only Southerners in the group. Both had attended high school together in Macon, playing in a number of bands during their teens. Michael Stipe (born January 4, 1960) was a military brat, moving throughout the country during his childhood. By his teens, he had discovered punk rock through Patti Smith, Television, and Wire, and began playing in cover bands in St. Louis. By 1978, he had begun studying art at the University of Georgia in Athens, where he began frequenting the Wuxtry record store. Peter Buck (born December 6, 1956), a native of California, was a clerk at Wuxtry. Buck had been a fanatical record collector, consuming everything from classic rock to punk and free jazz, and was just beginning to learn how to play guitar. Discovering they had similar tastes, Buck and Stipe began working together, eventually meeting Berry and Mills through a mutual friend. In April of 1980, the band formed to play a party for their friend, rehearsing a number of garage, psychedelic bubblegum, and punk covers in an converted Episcopalian church. At the time, the group was played under the name the Twisted Kites. By the summer, the band had settled on the name R.E.M. after flipping randomly through the dictionary, and had met Jefferson Holt, who became their manager after witnessing the group&apos;s first out-of-state concert in North Carolina.&#xD;&#xA;Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the South, playing a variety of garage rock covers and folk-rock originals. At the time, the band was still learning how to play, as Buck began to develop his distinctive, arpeggiated jangle and Stipe ironed out his cryptic lyrics. During the summer of 1981, R.E.M. recorded their first single, &quot;Radio Free Europe,&quot; at Mitch Easter&apos;s Drive-In Studios. Released on the local indie label Hib-Tone, &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot; was pressed in a run of only 1,000 copies, but most of the those singles fell into the right hands. Due to strong word of mouth, the single became a hit on college radio and topped the Village Voice&apos;s year-end poll of Best Independent Singles. The single also earned the attention of larger independent labels, and by the beginning of 1982, the band had signed to I.R.S. Records, releasing the EP Chronic Town in the spring. Like the single, Chronic Town was well received, paving the way for the group&apos;s full-length debut album, 1983&apos;s Murmur.&#xD;&#xA;With its subdued, haunting atmosphere and understated production, Murmur was noticeably different than Chronic Town and was welcomed with enthusiastic reviews upon its spring release; Rolling Stone named it the best album of 1983, beating out Michael Jackson&apos;s Thriller and the Police&apos;s Synchronicity. Murmur also expanded the group&apos;s cult significantly, breaking into the American Top 40. R.E.M. returned to a rougher-edged sound on 1984&apos;s Reckoning, which featured the college hit &quot;So. Central Rain (I&apos;m Sorry).&quot; By the time the band hit the road to support Reckoning, they had become well known in the American underground for their constant touring, aversion to videos, support of college radio, Stipe&apos;s mumbled vocals and detached stage presence, Buck&apos;s ringing guitar, and their purposely enigmatic artwork. Bands that imitated these very things ran rampant throughout the American underground, and R.E.M. threw their support toward these bands, having them open at shows and mentioning them in interviews. By 1985, the American underground was awash with R.E.M.soundalikess and bands like Game Theory and the Rain Parade, which shared similar aesthetics and sounds. &#xD;&#xA;Just as the signature R.E.M. sound dominated the underground, the band entered darker territory with its third album, 1985&apos;s Fables of the Reconstruction. Recorded in London with producer Joe Boyd (Richard Thompson, Fairport Convention, Nick Drake), Fables of the Reconstruction was made at a difficult period in R.E.M.&apos;s history, as the band was fraught with tension produced by endless touring. The album reflected the group&apos;s dark moods, as well as its obsession with the rural South, and both of these fascinations popped up on the supporting tour. Stipe, whose on-stage behavior was always slightly strange, entered his most bizarre phase, as he put on weight, dyed his hair bleached blonde, and wore countless layers of clothing. None of the new quirks in R.E.M.&apos;s persona prevented Fables of the Reconstruction from becoming their most successful album to date, selling nearly 300,000 copies in the U.S. R.E.M. decided to record their next album with Don Gehman, who had previously worked with John Mellencamp. Gehman had the band clean up its sound and Stipe enunciate his vocals, making Lifes Rich Pageant their most accessible record to date. Upon its late summer release in 1986, Lifes Rich Pageant was greeted with the positive reviews that had become customary with each new R.E.M. album, and it outstripped the sales of its predecessor. Several months after Lifes Rich Pageant, the group released the B-sides and rarities collection Dead Letter Office in the spring of 1987.&#xD;&#xA;R.E.M. had laid the groundwork for mainstream success, but they had never explicitly courted widespread success. Nevertheless, their audience had grown quite large, and it wasn&apos;t that surprising that the group&apos;s fifth album, Document, became a hit shortly after its fall 1987 release. Produced by Scott Litt -- who would produce all of their records over the course of the next decade -- Document climbed into the U.S. Top Ten and went platinum on the strength of the single &quot;The One I Love,&quot; which also went into the Top Ten; it also became their biggest U.K. hit to date, reaching the British Top 40. The following year, the band left I.R.S. Records, signing with Warner Bros. for a reported six million dollars. The first album under the new contract was Green, which was released on election day 1988. Green continued the success of Document, going double platinum and generating the Top Ten single &quot;Stand.&quot; R.E.M. supported Green with an exhaustive international tour, in which they played their first stadium dates in the U.S. Though they had graduated to stadiums in America, the group continued to play clubs throughout Europe. &#xD;&#xA;The Green tour proved to be draining for the group, and they took an extended rest upon its completion in 1989. During the break, each member pursued side projects, and Hindu Love Gods, an album Buck, Berry, and Mills recorded with Warren Zevon in 1986, was released. R.E.M. reconvened during 1990 to record their seventh album, Out of Time, which was released in the spring of 1991. Entering the U.S. and U.K. charts at number one, Out of Time was a lush pop and folk album, boasting a wider array of sounds than the group&apos;s previous efforts; its lead single, &quot;Losing My Religion,&quot; became the group&apos;s biggest single, reaching number four in the U.S. Since the band was exhausted from the Green tour, they chose to stay off the road. Nevertheless, Out of Time became their biggest album, selling over four million copies in the U.S. and spending two weeks at the top of the charts. R.E.M. released the dark, meditative Automatic for the People in the fall of 1992. Though the group had promised a rock album after the softer textures of Out of Time, Automatic for the People was slow, quiet, and reflective, with many songs being graced by string arrangements by Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Like its predecessor, Automatic for the People was a quadruple platinum success, generating the Top 40 hit singles &quot;Drive,&quot; &quot;Man on the Moon,&quot; and &quot;Everybody Hurts.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;After piecing together two albums in the studio, R.E.M. decided to return to being a rock band with 1994&apos;s Monster. Though the record was conceived as a back-to-basics album, the recording of Monster was difficult and plagued with tension. Nevertheless, the album was a huge hit upon its fall release, entering the U.S. and U.K. charts at number one; furthermore, the album won praise from a number of old-school critics who had been reluctant to praise the band, since they didn&apos;t &quot;rock&quot; in conventional terms. Experiencing some of the strongest sales and reviews of their career, R.E.M. began their first tour since Green early in 1995. Two months into the tour, Bill Berry suffered a brain aneurysm while performing; he had surgery immediately and had fully recovered within a month. R.E.M. resumed their tour two months after Berry&apos;s aneurysm, but his illness was only the beginning of a series of problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal tumor in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to remove a hernia. Despite all the problems, the tour was an enormous financial success, and the group recorded the bulk of a new album. Before the record was released in the fall of 1996, R.E.M. parted ways with their long-time manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against Holt; the group&apos;s lawyer, Bertis Downs, assumed managerial duties. &#xD;&#xA;New Adventures in Hi-Fi was released in September 1996, just before it was announced that the band had re-signed with Warner Bros., reportedly for a record-breaking sum of 80 million dollars. In light of such a huge figure, the commercial failure of New Adventures in Hi-Fi was ironic. Though it received strong reviews and debuted at number two in the U.S. and number one in the U.K., the album failed to generate a hit single, and it only went platinum where its three predecessors went quadruple platinum. By early 1997, the album had already begun its descent down the charts. However, the members of R.E.M. were already pursuing new projects, as Stipe worked with his film company, Single Cell Pictures, and Buck co-wrote songs with Mark Eitzel and worked with a free jazz group, Tuatara. &#xD;&#xA;In October of 1997, R.E.M. shocked fans and the media with the announcement that Berry was amicably exiting the group to retire to life on his farm; the remaining members continued on as a three-piece, soon convening in Hawaii to begin preliminary work on their next LP. Replacing Berry with a drum machine, the sessions resulted in 1998&apos;s Up, widely touted as R.E.M.&apos;s most experimental recording in years. It was only a brief change of direction, since the band&apos;s next album, 2001&apos;s Reveal, marked a return to their classic sound. Around the Sun followed in 2004. A world-wide tour convened in 2005, which included an appearance at the London branch of Live 8. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and began work on their next album, Accelerate, which was released in 2008. The album sported a faster, more guitar-driven sound than Around the Sun, which had received lukewarm reviews and sold poorly, particularly in America. It earned rave reviews and topped charts around the world (although it halted at number two in America). For 2011&apos;s Collapse into Now, the band favored a more expansive sound, one that combined Accelerate&apos;s rock songs with slower ballads and moody atmospherics. Reviews were mostly positive, and it debuted in the Top Five in America. Unexpectedly, in September 2011, the band announced its amicable breakup after 31 years together.  Immediately after the split, the band issued a double disc compilation entitled, Part Lies Part Heart Part Truth Part Garbage: 1982-2011, covering both their years at IRS and Warner. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61024/thumb/1445625520" art="/library/metadata/61024/art/1445625520" addedAt="1438453142" updatedAt="1445625520">

  <Directory ratingKey="64315" key="/library/metadata/64315/children" type="artist" title="Rachael Yamagata" summary="Singer/songwriter Rachael Yamagata grew up listening to Carole King, Roberta Flack, James Taylor, and the like, for music was the one thing in Yamagata&apos;s life that remained consistent. Her parents divorced when she was two, forcing her to find a balance between her German-Italian mother&apos;s apartment in New York City and the Washington, D.C. residence of her third-generation Japanese father. Such frequent travel readied Yamagata for a way of life that would eventually lead her to a professional singing career. By the time she reached Northwestern University in the mid-&apos;90s, Yamagata had one year of piano lessons and a spiral notebook full of songs under her belt. After pursuing a degree in French for one year, she relocated to New York to become an Italian theater major at Vassar. Sporadic changes loomed ahead, however. When her acting coach at Vassar moved to Barnard College, Yamagata thought she would go, too. She eventually opted to return to Northwestern instead, where she joined the theater program and befriended the funk band Bumpus during her junior year.&#xD;&#xA;Bumpus was a mainstay on the club circuit in Chicago, and Yamagata soon landed a gig singing with the band. She spent six years in the lineup, recording three albums and touring the country along the way. By 2001, however, Yamagata felt her time with Bumpus had run its course. She had a solid batch of songs that didn&apos;t gel with the band&apos;s funkafied formula, and a solo career was soon launched. &#xD;&#xA;In September 2002, Yamagata landed a deal with Arista&apos;s Private Music, and her self-titled EP arrived in October. Her first full-length album, Happenstance, followed in June 2004. Featuring production from John AlagÃ­a, who had previously helmed such albums as John Mayer&apos;s Room for Squares and Dave Matthews Band&apos;s Busted Stuff, the album&apos;s pop-tinged sound found its way onto several teen-driven TV shows, including The O.C. and Alias. Happenstance also endeared Yamagata to such musicians as Ray LaMontagne, Jason Mraz, Ryan Adams, Conor Oberst, and Rhett Miller, all of whom invited her to perform on their albums as Yamagata readied her sophomore effort. Boosted by such support, she returned in 2008 with Elephants...Teeth Sinking into Heart, an eclectic release that featured both intimate material and PJ Harvey-inspired rock. ~ MacKenzie Wilson &amp; Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64315/thumb/1445627229" art="/library/metadata/64315/art/1445627229" addedAt="1438447813" updatedAt="1445627229">

  <Directory ratingKey="59975" key="/library/metadata/59975/children" type="artist" title="Radiohead" summary="Radiohead were one of the few alternative bands of the early &apos;90s to draw heavily from the grandiose arena rock that characterized U2&apos;s early albums. But the band internalized that epic sweep, turning it inside out to tell tortured, twisted tales of angst and alienation. Vocalist Thom Yorke&apos;s pained lyrics were brought to life by the group&apos;s three-guitar attack, which relied on texture -- borrowing as much from My Bloody Valentine and Pink Floyd as R.E.M. and Pixies -- instead of virtuosity. It took Radiohead a while to formulate their signature sound. Their 1993 debut, Pablo Honey, only suggested their potential, and one of its songs, &quot;Creep,&quot; became an unexpected international hit, its angst-ridden lyrics making it an alternative rock anthem. Many observers pigeonholed Radiohead as a one-hit wonder, but the group&apos;s second album, The Bends, was released to terrific reviews in the band&apos;s native Britain in early 1995, helping build a more stable fan base. Having demonstrated unexpected staying power, as well as increasing ambition, Radiohead next released OK Computer, a progressive, electronic-tinged masterpiece that became one of the most acclaimed albums of the &apos;90s.&#xD;&#xA;Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar), Ed O&apos;Brien (guitar, vocals), Jonny Greenwood (guitar), Colin Greenwood (bass), and Phil Selway (drums) formed Radiohead as students in 1988 while living in Oxford. Initially called &quot;On a Friday,&quot; the band began pursuing a musical career in earnest in the early &apos;90s, releasing the Drill EP in 1992. Shortly afterward, the group signed to EMI/Capitol and released the single &quot;Creep,&quot; a fusion of R.E.M. and Nirvana highlighted by a noisy burst of feedback prior to the chorus. &quot;Creep&quot; was a moderate hit, and their next two singles, &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot; and &quot;Pop Is Dead,&quot; gained a small following, even as the British music press ignored the group. &#xD;&#xA;Pablo Honey, Radiohead&apos;s album, was released to mixed reviews in the spring of 1993. As the band launched a European supporting tour, &quot;Creep&quot; became a sudden smash hit in America, earning heavy airplay on modern rock radio and MTV. On the back of the single&apos;s success, Radiohead toured the U.S. extensively, opening for Belly and Tears for Fears. All the exposure helped Pablo Honey go gold, and &quot;Creep&quot; was re-released in the U.K. at the end of 1993. This time, the single became a Top Ten hit, and the band spent the following summer touring the world.&#xD;&#xA;Although &quot;Creep&quot; made Radiohead a success, it also led many observers to peg the band as a one-hit wonder. Conscious of such thinking, the group entered the studio with producer John Leckie to record its second album, The Bends. Upon its spring 1995 release, The Bends was greeted with overwhelmingly enthusiastic reviews, all of which praised the group&apos;s deeper, more mature sound. However, positive reviews didn&apos;t sell albums, as Radiohead struggled to be heard during the U.K.&apos;s summer of Brit-pop and as American radio programmers and MTV ignored the record. The band continued to tour as the opening act on R.E.M.&apos;s prestigious Monster tour. By the end of the year, The Bends began to catch on, thanks not only to the band&apos;s constant touring but also to the stark, startling video for &quot;Just.&quot; The album made many year-end best-of lists in the U.K., and early in 1996, the record reentered the British Top Ten and climbed to gold status in the U.S., helped in the latter by the video for &quot;Fake Plastic Trees.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;During the first half of 1996, Radiohead continued to tour before re-entering the studio that fall to record their third album, OK Computer, which was released in the summer of 1997. A devoted following of fans and a handful of enthusiastic critical supporters immediately embraced the album&apos;s majestic blend of unfettered prog rock, post-punk angst, eerie electronic textures, and assured songwriting. Since it skillfully teetered between rock classicism and futurism, it earned near-unanimous critical and popular support over the course of the year, which turned into unrestrained adoration in the final two years of the decade, even though its sales still hadn&apos;t climbed above gold status. &#xD;&#xA;Expectations for Radiohead&apos;s fourth album were stratospheric, which placed additional pressure on the already perfectionist band, and led to several stumbling blocks along the way. An intense buzz of excitement among the band&apos;s still-growing following greeted the pre-release appearance of most of the album&apos;s tracks on the Internet in MP3 form; they displayed an all-out fascination with challenging, often minimalist electronica. Titled Kid A, the album was finally released in October 2000 and astonished many observers by debuting at number one on the U.S. album charts. While the band didn&apos;t release any singles or embark on a formal tour, the album met with a mixed critical response as the group was accused of creating a distant and radio-unfriendly record; however, it did remain a fan favorite. &#xD;&#xA;In June of 2001, Radiohead quickly released an album under the name Amnesiac that consisted of material that was recorded during the Kid A sessions. The band made it very clear, though, that it was not to be considered an outtakes album; rather, they insisted that the two albums were of clear and separate concept. Regardless, Amnesiac debuted at number one in the U.K. and number two on the U.S. chart (behind then-stronghold Staind), while outselling Kid A in week one by 25,000 copies. The singles &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Knives Out&quot; were culled from Amnesiac with a subsequent world tour. While planning &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; for a third single, the idea expanded into a live &quot;mini-album,&quot; titled after the track, that was released in November of 2001. Hail to the Thief, the proper follow-up to Amnesiac, was relatively direct in structure and peaked at number three on the U.S. chart. Sporadic recording sessions resumed in early 2005, but a projected release date for the band&apos;s seventh studio album remained 2007 as Yorke prepared a solo album, The Eraser, which was issued in July 2006. &#xD;&#xA;On October 1, 2007, the bandmembers announced that they had finished their seventh album, In Rainbows, and that it would be &quot;out&quot; in a matter of ten days. Giving fans the option to pay whatever they&apos;d like for the album as a zip file of MP3s, Radiohead also devised a pre-order system for the physical version of the album -- a &quot;discbox&quot; containing a double-vinyl version, a CD copy with an enhanced six-track bonus disc, a lyric book, and photos. This was done without the involvement of a record label. However, deals were eventually struck for standard retail releases. In late December, XL issued the album in the U.K., where it topped the album chart. The feat was repeated the following month in the U.S., where it was issued through the TBD label. Sonically and lyrically, In Rainbows was one of their warmest and most direct albums to date.  &#xD;&#xA;Radiohead took a somewhat similar approach for the release of The King of Limbs. On February 14, 2011, the band announced that the album would be issued in five days as a fixed-price download with physical releases to follow. Standard CD and vinyl versions were scheduled for late March via XL and TBD, while an elaborately packaged double 10&quot; vinyl/CD set was scheduled for early May. The two-disc TKOL RMX 1234567 followed five months later, featuring 19 remixes of King of Limbs tracks from the likes of Jamie xx, Caribou, Four Tet, and Nathan Fake. The band also recorded a live set of songs from the album as part of the From the Basement video series, and subsequently released the set, titled King of Limbs: Live from the Basement, in 2012. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Andy Kellman" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59975/thumb/1445625076" art="/library/metadata/59975/art/1445625076" addedAt="1438447860" updatedAt="1445625076">

  <Directory ratingKey="59079" key="/library/metadata/59079/children" type="artist" title="Razorlight" summary="The British indie rock band Razorlight formed in London in 2002 around vocalist/guitarist Johnny Borrell and guitarist/vocalist (and Swedish ex-pat) BjÃ¶rn Ãgnen. Joined by bassist Carl Dalemo and drummer Christian Smith-Pancorvo, the combo recorded several demos at London&apos;s Toe Rag studios, and those songs led to radio exposure and the initial stirrings of hype. Mercury Records signed Razorlight in 2003, and the group began recording its debut album amidst a series of hectic (and increasingly buzzworthy) club gigs, working with no less an authority than Steve Lillywhite. Lillywhite soon left the project, but Razorlight continued to write and record the album while still wowing audiences with a spate of live dates, including a strong showing at the 2004 South by Southwest industry fest. &#xD;&#xA;At this point, drummer Smith-Pancorvo left the group and was soon replaced by Andy Burrows. Thus reconfigured, Razorlight made their official album debut in August 2004 with Up All Night. The release was hailed for its stylish, fizzy mix of Strokes-styled sensibilities and post-Brit-pop cool. Additional show dates opening for the likes of Queen (with vocalist Paul Rodgers) and Oasis gave Razorlight some of their biggest audiences in 2005, adding to the bandmates&apos; growing popularity in their native U.K. The band&apos;s second offering, a self-titled effort produced by Chris Thomas, arrived in summer 2006 and yielded Razorlight&apos;s first chart-topping single, &quot;America.&quot; The album itself also topped the U.K. charts, going multi-platinum in the process, and Razorlight maintained their presence on British radio throughout 2007 before embracing a slick, mainstream pop/rock style on 2008&apos;s Slipway Fires. ~ Johnny Loftus" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59079/thumb/1445624743" art="/library/metadata/59079/art/1445624743" addedAt="1438452660" updatedAt="1445624743">

  <Directory ratingKey="60967" key="/library/metadata/60967/children" type="artist" title="Red Hot Chili Peppers" summary="Few rock groups of the &apos;80s broke down as many musical barriers and were as original as the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Creating an intoxicating new musical style by combining funk and punk rock together (with an explosive stage show to boot), the Chili Peppers spawned a slew of imitators in their wake, but still managed to be the leaders of the pack by the dawn of the 21st century. The roots of the band lay in a friendship forged by three school chums, Anthony Kiedis, Michael Balzary, and Hillel Slovak, while they attended Fairfax High School in California back in the late &apos;70s/early &apos;80s. While Balzary and Slovak showed great musical promise (on trumpet and guitar, respectively), Kiedis focused on poetry and acting during his high-school career. During this time, Slovak taught Balzary how to play bass, while the duo encouraged Kiedis to start putting his poetry to music, which he soon did. Influenced heavily by the burgeoning L.A. punk scene (the Germs, Black Flag, Fear, Minutemen, X, etc.) as well as funk (Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, etc.), the trio began to rehearse with another friend, drummer Jack Irons, leading to the formation of Tony Flow &amp; the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem, a quartet that played strip bars along the Sunset Strip during the early &apos;80s. It was during this time that the four honed their sound and live act (as they stumbled across a stage gimmick that would soon become their trademark -- performing on-stage completely naked, except for a tube sock covering a certain part of their anatomy). By 1983, Balzary had begun to go by the name &quot;Flea,&quot; and the group changed its name to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. &#xD;&#xA;Word spread quickly about the up-and-coming band, resulting in a recording contract with EMI. But before the Chili Peppers could begin work on their debut, Flea and Kiedis were dealt a disappointing blow when both Slovak and Irons announced that they were leaving to focus more on another band they were in, What Is This. With replacement members Jack Sherman (guitar) and Cliff Martinez (drums) filling in, the Peppers released their self-titled debut in 1984. But the absence of the two original members showed, as the album failed to capture the excitement of their live show. While the album didn&apos;t set the world on fire sales-wise, the group began to build a dedicated underground following with college radio buffs. By 1985, What Is This were kaput (after issuing a single self-titled album) and Slovak and Irons returned to the Peppers, resulting in the George Clinton-produced Freaky Styley. While the album was an improvement over its predecessor, it still lacked the fire of the band&apos;s in-concert experience, a problem that would finally be solved with their next album, 1987&apos;s The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. The album was the group&apos;s first to make an impression on the charts, and they followed it up a year later with a stopgap five-track release, The Abbey Road EP, in 1988. But just as the world was warming up to the Peppers, tragedy struck when Slovak died from a heroin overdose on June 25, 1988. &#xD;&#xA;In the wake of Slovak&apos;s death, Irons left the group for the second and final time, while Kiedis (who was also battling drug addiction at the time) and Flea decided to soldier on. After a new lineup featuring former Parliament guitarist Blackbyrd McKnight and former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro didn&apos;t work out, the duo found worthy replacements in newcomers John Frusciante and Chad Smith. The new-look Chili Peppers hit pay dirt straight away, as their first album together, 1989&apos;s Mother&apos;s Milk, became a surprise hit due to MTV&apos;s exposure of their videos for a cover of Stevie Wonder&apos;s &quot;Higher Ground&quot; and a song about their fallen friend Slovak, &quot;Knock Me Down,&quot; as the album was certified gold by early 1990. The bandmembers knew that their next release would be the most important one of their career, so they moved into a mansion-turned-recording studio with producer Rick Rubin to work on what would become their most successful release yet, the stripped-down Blood Sugar Sex Magik (their first for the Warner Bros. label). The album became a monster hit upon its September 1991 release (eventually going on to sell a staggering seven million copies in the U.S. alone), as it spawned such hits as &quot;Give It Away&quot; and the group&apos;s first Top Ten single, &quot;Under the Bridge.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;But not all was well in the Chili Peppers camp. Like his predecessor, Frusciante had become addicted to hard drugs, and abruptly left the band mid-tour in early 1992. Undeterred, the band enlisted new member Arik Marshall, and headlined Lollapalooza II in the summer. When the band returned to the studio to work on its sixth release overall, it quickly became apparent that Marshall didn&apos;t fit in, and he was replaced by Jesse Tobias. But before Tobias could record a note with the group, he was handed his walking papers as well, and former Jane&apos;s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro signed on. After a layoff of four years, the Peppers&apos; much delayed follow-up to BSSM was released in 1995, One Hot Minute. While the album was a sizable hit, it failed to match the success and musical focus of its predecessor, as it became apparent during the album&apos;s ensuing tour that Navarro wasn&apos;t fitting in as well as originally hoped, and he left the band in early 1998. &#xD;&#xA;After Frusciante had left the group, he released a pair of obscure solo releases, 1995&apos;s Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt and 1997&apos;s Smile from the Streets You Hold, yet rumors circulated that the guitarist was homeless, penniless, and sickly with a death-defying drug habit. After checking himself into rehab and putting his demons behind him, Frusciante emerged once again refocused and re-energized, and promptly accepted an invitation to rejoin the Peppers once more. The group&apos;s reunion album, 1999&apos;s Californication, proved to be another monster success, reconfirming the Chili Peppers as one of alternative rock&apos;s top bands. The band put in a quick guest appearance on Fishbone&apos;s Psychotic Friends Nuttwerx before hitting the road to support the album. The following months found the band getting involved in bizarre situations and controversies. First, their refusal to play songs from One Hot Minute during the tour was an unpopular decision with some fans and a sore spot for Dave Navarro. Next, they re-ignited a personal feud between Kiedis and Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton by refusing to play a series of European concerts with Bungle. Patton responded with a &quot;tribute&quot; show for the Peppers, where Bungle mocked their stage moves, faked shooting up heroin, and imitated Kiedis&apos; comments about Patton. They also played the ill-fated Woodstock &apos;99 festival, where their headlining performance was met with piles of burning rubble and a full-scale riot. Tours with the Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam brought them into the next year without problems, but they stepped off the road after a planned stop in Israel was halted due to security worries. They returned to the studio in November of 2001 and by the summer of 2002 they had a new album ready to drop, By the Way. Warner Bros. released a Greatest Hits compilation in 2003, followed by a chart-topping two-CD album of all-new material, Stadium Arcadium, in 2006. &#xD;&#xA;After an extensive supporting tour, the Red Hot Chili Peppers took an extended hiatus and the members pursued individual interests. Flea began studying music theory at USC and played in a variety of side projects. Kiedis attempted to turn his autobiography, Scar Tissue, into a television show. Smith joined Sammy Hagar, Michael Anthony, and Joe Satriani in the party supergroup Chickenfoot. Frusciante released The Empyrean in 2009, by which time he left the band. His replacement was Josh Klinghoffer, who played secondary guitar on the Stadium Arcadium tour. Klinghoffer&apos;s first album with the band, I&apos;m with You, was released in late summer of 2011. ~ Greg Prato" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60967/thumb/1445625493" art="/library/metadata/60967/art/1445625493" addedAt="1438453169" updatedAt="1445625493">

  <Directory ratingKey="59038" key="/library/metadata/59038/children" type="artist" title="Rihanna" summary="Rihanna established her dance-pop credentials in summer 2005 with her debut smash hit, &quot;Pon de Replay,&quot; and continued to demonstrate hit potential in subsequent years (e.g., &quot;S.O.S.&quot; in 2006; &quot;Umbrella&quot; in 2007; &quot;Disturbia&quot; in 2008). However, it was the singer&apos;s third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, that made her a full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts. Born Robyn Rihanna Fenty on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados, she exhibited a certain star quality as a young child, often winning beauty and talent contests. Because she lived on the fairly remote island of Barbados in the West Indies, however, she never foresaw the sort of stardom she would later attain.&#xD;&#xA;That stardom came courtesy of a fateful meeting with Evan Rogers. The New Yorker was vacationing in Barbados with his wife, a native of the island, when he was introduced to Rihanna. Rogers had spent years producing pop hits for such superstars as *NSYNC, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Kelly Clarkson, Laura Pausini, and Rod Stewart, and he offered the talented Rihanna a chance to record. Along with Rogers&apos; production partner, Carl Sturken (the other half of Syndicated Rhythm Productions), Rihanna recorded several demos that sparked the interest of the Carter Administration -- that is, the newly appointed Def Jam president Shawn &quot;Jay-Z&quot; Carter. This led to an audition, and Rihanna both received and accepted an on-the-spot offer to sign with Def Jam. &#xD;&#xA;Come summer 2005, Def Jam rolled out &quot;Pon de Replay,&quot; the lively leadoff single from Music of the Sun. Produced almost entirely by Rogers and Sturken, the song synthesized Caribbean rhythms with urban-pop songwriting. &quot;Pon de Replay&quot; caught fire almost immediately, climbing all the way to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and contesting the half-summer reign of Mariah Carey&apos;s &quot;We Belong Together&quot; atop the chart. The debut album spawned one other hit, &quot;If It&apos;s Lovin&apos; That You Want,&quot; which also broke the Top 40. Rihanna&apos;s follow-up effort, A Girl Like Me, saw even greater success and spawned three sizable singles: a chart-topper (&quot;S.O.S.&quot;) and two Top Ten hits (&quot;Unfaithful,&quot; &quot;Break It Off&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;Rihanna&apos;s third album, 2007&apos;s Good Girl Gone Bad, continued her success while signaling a change of direction. Whereas her past two albums had been imbalanced -- often weighed down by faceless balladry and canned Caribbean-isms -- Good Girl Gone Bad was a first-rate dance-pop album, stacked with several chart-topping singles and boasting collaborations with Jay-Z, Ne-Yo, Timbaland, and StarGate. The lead single, &quot;Umbrella,&quot; shot to number one, as did &quot;Take a Bow&quot; and &quot;Disturbia.&quot; Its success turned Rihanna into one of the planet&apos;s biggest pop stars. &#xD;&#xA;Rated R was released in 2009 during the wake of a physical altercation with romantic interest Chris Brown, who pleaded guilty to felony assault. The album&apos;s lead single, &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; -- written with Ne-Yo -- was one of the year&apos;s most controversial singles, and it set the tone for the singer&apos;s new, dark direction. Rated R peaked within the Top Five of the Billboard 200, while another one of its singles, &quot;Rude Boy,&quot; topped the Hot 100. Rated R: Remixed was released in the spring of 2010 and featured ten tracks from the album revamped for the dancefloor by Chew Fu.&#xD;&#xA;Loud, Rihanna&apos;s fifth studio album, followed in November and was led by the StarGate-produced &quot;Only Girl (In the World).&quot; That song, as well as the follow-up singles &quot;What&apos;s My Name?&quot; and &quot;S&amp;M,&quot; all topped the Billboard Hot 100. In November 2011, shortly after Loud&apos;s &quot;Cheers (Drink to That)&quot; entered the Top Ten, the singer released Talk That Talk. The single &quot;We Found Love&quot; with Calvin Harris earned the top spot in the Hot 100, and the album peaked at number three. Unapologetic, her seventh studio album, featured some of her brashest material and was led by &quot;Diamonds&quot; -- her 18th Top Ten single. ~ Jason Birchmeier" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59038/thumb/1445624750" art="/library/metadata/59038/art/1445624750" addedAt="1438451622" updatedAt="1445624750">

  <Directory ratingKey="58978" key="/library/metadata/58978/children" type="artist" title="Rob Thomas" summary="As the lead singer and principal songwriter for Matchbox Twenty, Rob Thomas found success with a blend of &apos;70s rock influences, slick hooks, and 1990s post-grunge crunch.  The Florida-based band broke through in 1996 with &quot;Push&quot; and never looked back, issuing single after single, scoring hits in various radio formats, and watching their debut LP, Yourself or Someone Like You, go platinum 12 times over in the U.S. Thomas himself won numerous songwriting awards as the scribe of such Matchbox hits (including &quot;Real World,&quot; &quot;If You&apos;re Gone,&quot; &quot;Bent,&quot; and &quot;Mad Season&quot;), and he later parlayed that success into a career as a solo artist. &#xD;&#xA;Rob Thomas was born February 14, 1972, on an Army base in Landstuhl, Germany. His parents divorced, and the ex-Army brat spent most of his childhood in South Carolina and Florida. After dropping out of high school at 17, he bounced around the South singing in pickup rock bands before relocating to Orlando in 1993. There, he helped form the band Tabitha&apos;s Secret, a precursor to Matchbox Twenty. Although the group enjoyed some regional success, Thomas eventually left the lineup with bassist Brian Yale and drummer Paul Doucette in tow, and the departing musicians formed Matchbox Twenty with guitarists Adam Gaynor and Kyle Cook. The band&apos;s multi-platinum debut, Yourself or Someone Like You, established Matchbox Twenty as a superstar act, but Thomas wasn&apos;t individually well known. &#xD;&#xA;That all changed when Thomas co-wrote the chart-topping single &quot;Smooth&quot; for the Carlos Santana album Supernatural. &quot;Smooth&quot; was ubiquitous in 1999, and it made Thomas a star. The track took home three Grammys, including the coveted &quot;Song of the Year&quot; award, and Thomas landed on People&apos;s &quot;Most Beautiful People&quot; list. Meanwhile, he also married model Marisol Maldonado. Mad Season (2000) and More Than You Think You Are (2002) continued Matchbox Twenty&apos;s success, but after years of touring in support of both records, the bandmembers decided they needed a break, and Thomas used the hiatus to write and record his first solo album. When &quot;Lonely No More&quot; debuted in early 2005, its sleek and funky dance-pop sound was closer to Justin Timberlake than Matchbox, and it helped stir up anticipation for the April release of the chart-topping Something to Be. Rob Thomas returned to the Matchbox Twenty fold several years later, but he also maintained work on his solo material, the second batch of which arrived in 2009 under the title cradlesong. ~ Johnny Loftus" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58978/thumb/1445624725" art="/library/metadata/58978/art/1445624725" addedAt="1438452150" updatedAt="1445624725">

  <Directory ratingKey="58957" key="/library/metadata/58957/children" type="artist" title="Robbie Williams" summary="Out of all the members of Take That, Robbie Williams never really seemed to fit in. Roguishly handsome where his bandmates were merely cute, Williams was tougher and sexier than the rest, which made him more distinctive. He also fought regularly with the other members and their management, primarily because he was occasionally adverse to being so heavily packaged. So it didn&apos;t come as a surprise that he was the first to leave the band, departing early in the summer of 1995 to pursue a solo career (by some accounts, he was fired from the group). &#xD;&#xA;Although he was the first out of the gate, it took Williams a while to get started. For most of 1995, he attempted to boost his credibility by tagging along with Oasis, hoping that Noel Gallagher would give him a couple of songs. He never did, but all of his time with Oasis launched Williams into a world of heavy partying, drinking, and drugging. Over the course of 1996, he was only heard from in gossip columns, and every published picture indicated he had put on considerable weight. Occasionally, he was quoted as saying his new music would abandon lightweight dance-pop for traditional Brit-pop, but his first single was a cover of George Michael&apos;s &quot;Freedom &apos;90.&quot; Released late in 1996, the single was a disaster, but his second single, 1997&apos;s &quot;Old Before I Die,&quot; was more in the vein of his early pronouncements, featuring a distinct Oasis influence.&#xD;&#xA;Williams finally released his first solo album, Life Thru a Lens, in 1997. The album became a big hit in Britain, prompting his second, I&apos;ve Been Expecting You, to go multi-platinum upon its release in 1998. (The Ego Has Landed, a U.S.-only compilation designed for breaking Williams to American audiences, was released stateside in the spring of 1999.) Sing When You&apos;re Winning followed in late 2000, gaining success with the video hit &quot;Rock DJ,&quot; while a big-band album of standards (Swing When You&apos;re Winning) appeared a year later. By this point, Robbie Williams had become one of Europe&apos;s premier pop stars, known for his headline-grabbing behavior as much as his hit-studded albums. Moreover, his solo work had sold far more copies than his work with Take That.&#xD;&#xA;During 2002, Williams celebrated an enormous new contract with EMI (rumored to be upwards of 80 million dollars), but suffered the loss of his longtime production partner, Guy Chambers. Escapology, the fifth Robbie Williams album (and the last including Chambers&apos; input), sold millions of copies in Europe, though it failed to persuade American audiences. As a result, the 2003 concert record Live at Knebworth wasn&apos;t released in the States. He introduced a new musical partner, Stephen Duffy, with a pair of songs from his compilation Greatest Hits, then reappeared in 2005 with Intensive Care. Although the album topped charts in Europe and helped Williams set an impressive concert record -- his 2006 world tour sold over one-and-a-half-million tickets in one day -- a certain creative atrophy was setting in, despite the new input of Duffy. &#xD;&#xA;Within a year, he had recorded and released Rudebox, a dance album recorded with half-a-dozen outside producers, some featured guests, and several covers instead of self-penned material. Rudebox hit number one across Europe but only went double platinum in the U.K., becoming his lowest-selling studio album to date. Accordingly, Williams&apos; next album -- the 2009 release Reality Killed the Video Star -- found him returning to the sound of his older albums, with the Buggles&apos; Trevor Horn handling all production duties. &#xD;&#xA;The following year, most news of Robbie Williams surrounded his reunion with Take That, which took the form of a new album, Progress, plus a few new songs recorded with bandmate Gary Barlow that were released on a new Williams hits collection, In and Out of Consciousness: Greatest Hits 1990-2010. Barlow also figured in the writing and production of the ninth Robbie Williams studio album, Take the Crown, released in late 2012. Produced by Williams alongside Jacknife Lee (Snow Patrol, R.E.M., Bloc Party), the album saw Williams return to the eclectic pop sound of his earlier work, with a trailer single (&quot;Candy&quot;) written by Williams and Barlow. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58957/thumb/1445624729" art="/library/metadata/58957/art/1445624729" addedAt="1438453287" updatedAt="1445624729">

Raised primarily on the classic American soul sound of the 1970s, Miles began studying piano as a teen, and at 13 began DJing local house parties. By the late &apos;80s he was regularly spinning hardcore trance sets at Venice area clubs under the name Robert Milani, eventually adopting the name Miles as symbolic of the musical journey awaiting him. In time, he assembled a basic studio system comprising a sampler, mixer, keyboard, and 32-track digital board, accepting production work with the Italian label Metromaxx.&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Children&quot; was inspired by a collection of photos taken by Miles&apos; father while stationed in war-torn Yugoslavia; the DJ was equally disturbed by the growing number of deaths plaguing the Italian rave community, and he soon began work on &quot;Children,&quot; a simple, piano-driven instrumental anthem produced at a cost of only Â£150. Originally issued in 1994, the single slowly emerged as an international blockbuster, topping charts in Germany, France, Holland, and Belgium on its way to becoming the biggest European single of 1996; it also fell just shy of reaching the Top 20 on the American pop charts. &#xD;&#xA;After its follow-up, &quot;Fable,&quot; Miles issued his debut LP, Dreamland, with its Dreamland II remix companion appearing a short time later. He resurfaced in 1997 with 23 AM. Miles&apos; next full-length, Organik, arrived in 2001 and featured appearances by Bill Laswell, Trilok Gurtu, and Talvin Singh. The double-disc set Organik Remixes was issued two years later, followed by a collaborative release with Gurtu in 2004. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64138/thumb/1445627119" art="/library/metadata/64138/art/1445627119" addedAt="1438447924" updatedAt="1445627119">

  <Directory ratingKey="59934" key="/library/metadata/59934/children" type="artist" title="Robert Plant" summary="In 1968, a naÃ¯ve young singer from the Black Country hills in England named Robert Plant was discovered wailing the blues by veteran session guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones. When Plant recommended his friend John Bonham as the drummer, one of the most successful bands in rock history was born as Led Zeppelin. But the group that started with such force also ended in flames after 12 years, as Bonham&apos;s death from alcohol poisoning in 1980 split the band after nine albums. The remaining members went their separate ways, but Bonham&apos;s death hit Plant particularly hard. Starting his solo career in 1982 with his Zeppelin-like Pictures at Eleven album, Plant would use a slew of great drummers over the next few years, including Phil Collins, Cozy Powell, Barriemore Barlow, and Richie Hayward. Collins appeared on the 1983 follow-up, The Principle of Moments, and Plant achieved a lighter touch somewhere between Genesis and Zeppelin&apos;s quieter side with tracks like &quot;In the Mood&quot; and &quot;Big Log.&quot; But the singer would feed his Elvis Presley infatuation on 1984&apos;s The Honeydrippers, Vol. 1, teaming with Page and other guests on influential roots rock material. &#xD;&#xA;Refusing to be typecast, Plant then threw a major curve with Shaken &apos;n&apos; Stirred, the 1985 album that approximated new wave through the synthesizer embellishments of keyboardist Jezz Woodroffe and guitarist Robbie Blunt, plus Hayward&apos;s use of electronic drums. It was a creative highlight of his career, but despite a hit in &quot;Little by Little,&quot; the album sold poorly, and the rumblings about a Zeppelin reunion mounted. Plant took the next few years off, then answered the call for Zeppelin material with 1988&apos;s Now &amp; Zen, which featured samples from his old group (plus selections from its vault on the subsequent tour). Manic Nirvana furthered the post-Zeppelin theme in 1990, and Plant&apos;s 1993 CD Fate of Nations proved another artistic high point and found Plant singing Page&apos;s name on the hit &quot;Calling to You.&quot; The old songwriting partners had gotten together again for special occasions with Jones and drummers like Collins and Bonham&apos;s son Jason, but organized a different reunion in 1994. Plant brought in his bassist, Charlie Jones, and touring drummer, Michael Lee, to back the singer and Page -- who added a British symphony orchestra and Middle Eastern musicians for their televised No Quarter concert and CD. Despite Plant blocking John Paul Jones from participating (the two had disagreed throughout their careers), the show proved a fascinating blend of different cultures tackling Zeppelin classics like &quot;Since I&apos;ve Been Loving You&quot; and &quot;Gallows Pole.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;As the versatile John Paul Jones made a name for himself as a producer (of groups as disparate as Heart and the Butthole Surfers) as well as solo artist, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page further stirred the ashes with their 1998 studio CD, Walking into Clarksdale. But the quartet format (with Charlie Jones and Michael Lee) paled in comparison to Zeppelin&apos;s similar blend of bombast and subtlety, and poor sales put Plant back at the crossroads of his 35-year career. He stayed away from recording until late 2001, when he stepped into the studio with a batch of original material and a few well-chosen covers and recorded Dreamland. Taking his penchant for experimenting with ethnic musics and blending it with a softer approach to his bluesy pop, he steered in another interesting direction almost 40 years into his recording career. In November 2003, Atlantic issued Sixty Six to Timbuktu, a two-disc compilation dedicated exclusively to Plant&apos;s solo work. The set ranged from hits like 1988&apos;s &quot;Tall Cool One&quot; and the Honeydrippers favorite &quot;Sea of Love&quot; to the previously unissued &quot;Upside Down&quot; and a pre-Zeppelin single dating from 1966. Mighty Rearranger followed two years later, and Plant teamed up with bluegrass icon Alison Krauss to release the Grammy-winning collaborative album Raising Sand in 2007. Plant next revived the name of his first band, Band of Joy, in 2010 for the self-titled Band of Joy release, which was co-produced by Buddy Miller. ~ Bill Meredith" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59934/thumb/1445625029" art="/library/metadata/59934/art/1445625029" addedAt="1438447464" updatedAt="1445625029">

  <Directory ratingKey="60944" key="/library/metadata/60944/children" type="artist" title="Rodrigo Y Gabriela" summary="Before they became the most visible flamenco duo of the early 2000s, guitarists Rodrigo Sanchez and Gabriela Quintero bonded over heavy metal while growing up in Mexico City. They combined their talents for a time in the metal group Tierra Acida, playing around D.F. in the roughest clubs the city had to offer. Though they recorded some material, Tierra Acida never hit it big, and an album was never released. Instead, Sanchez and Quintero concentrated on learning more guitar styles, teaching lessons during the day, and playing bossa novas in hotel bars at night. Bored and frustrated with their chances in the Americas, the two decided to try their luck in Europe instead.&#xD;&#xA;Rodrigo y Gabriela traveled to Dublin, where a friend had offered them a place to stay. The musicians spoke no English, carried little money, and upon their arrival found that their offer of European hospitality had vanished. The pair soon turned toward busking on the streets of Dublin, a move that enhanced their reputation and helped land them several contacts. Among their newfound friends was fellow busker Damien Rice, who soon asked them to accompany him on tour. The Mexican duo had, by this time, developed a large repertoire of original material in a variety of styles, and they released their debut record with 2003&apos;s Re-Foc. A concert album, Live: Manchester and Dublin, followed one year later. &#xD;&#xA;Rodrigo y Gabriela became the newest fixture of the world music circuit, known for their nimble-fingered guitar work and diverse background (few flamenco guitarists could boast a background in metal music). Their third album, Rodrigo y Gabriela, was released in 2006 and debuted atop the Irish charts, beating out Arctic Monkeys for the number one spot. They continued to tour, making their way through Japan (as evidenced by their second live album, Live in Japan) and America, and 11:11 expanded their discography upon its 2009 release. The duo went on a touring hiatus in September 2010 due to stress injuries to Gabriela&apos;s hand. In January of 2011, they collaborated with film composer Hans Zimmer on the score for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, which was released in May of that year, followed by Live in France, a document from the 11:11 tour that like the studio album, mixed  Rodrigo y Gabriela&apos;s dazzling nylon-string guitar chops with  electric six-strings for a dueling shredfest.&#xD;&#xA;Since their inception, the pair had always envisioned working in Cuba. They recruited pianist and arranger Alex Wilson to come up with charts for a new set of songs. Wilson and the duo worked out a set of tunes, rhythms, and charts in three days in Mexico City, then Wilson went on to Cuba to hire a band. From June through September, the duo recorded with Wilson and C.U.B.A. (Collective Universal Band Association) in Havana, with producer Peter Asher. A number of special guests joined the proceedings as well, including Anoushka Shankar, flamenco and jazz bass legend Carlos Benavent, former Testament and White Zombie drummer John Tempesta, Le Trio Joubran, and Los Van Van drummer Samuel Formell Alfonso. The resulting album, Area 52, was released in January of 2012. ~ Evan C.

Before they collaborated, Jackson, the daughter of actress Trudie Goodwin, grew up listening to folk artists and singer/songwriters like Nick Drake and Joni Mitchell, and drew inspiration from their sounds for her early music. However, Jackson&apos;s style changed as she got into the rave scene, taking her music in a more electronic direction. Meanwhile, Langmaid had gone to school with Rollo from Faithless, and the two recorded as house duo Huff &amp; Puff in the mid-&apos;90s; Langmaid also recorded as Atomic and as one half of Huff &amp; Herb for Rollo&apos;s label, and was a songwriter for the group Kubb. Jackson and Langmaid began working together in 2006, when they were introduced by a mutual acquaintance. Initially, they called their project Automan and wrote largely acoustic music before scrapping that name and sound for the sleek Prince, David Bowie, and the Knife-inspired style they pursued as La Roux, a moniker Jackson found in a book of baby names. Their debut single, &quot;Quicksand,&quot; was released by Kitsune in fall 2008, and earned the band acclaim from the BBC and the Guardian. La Roux supported Lily Allen on her 2009 U.K. tour around the time their second single, &quot;In for the Kill,&quot; was released that spring and debuted at 11 on the U.K. charts, reaching a peak position of two; that summer, the single &quot;Bulletproof&quot; debuted at number one a week before La Roux&apos;s self-titled album was released. La Roux arrived in the States that fall. Late that year, the duo began working on new material that steered away from the heavy &apos;80s influence of its debut. In early 2010, Skream&apos;s remix of &quot;In for the Kill&quot; won Best Dancefloor Filler at the NME Shockwave Awards. That summer, &quot;Bulletproof&quot; entered the Top Ten of Billboard&apos;s Hot 100 singles chart, and La Roux released the mix album Sidetracked. ~ Heather Phares" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59640/thumb/1445624938" art="/library/metadata/59640/art/1445624938" addedAt="1438451800" updatedAt="1445624938">

  <Directory ratingKey="64128" key="/library/metadata/64128/children" type="artist" title="Rush" summary="Over the course of their decades-spanning career, Canadian power trio Rush emerged as one of hard rock&apos;s most highly regarded bands; although typically brushed aside by critics and rarely the recipients of mainstream pop radio airplay, Rush nonetheless won an impressive and devoted fan following, while their virtuoso performance skills solidified their standing as musicians&apos; musicians.&#xD;&#xA;Rush formed in Toronto, Ontario, in the autumn of 1968, initially comprised of guitarist Alex Lifeson (born Alexander Zivojinovich), vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee (born Gary Lee Weinrib), and drummer John Rutsey. In their primary incarnation, Rush drew a heavy influence from Cream, and honed their skills on the Toronto club circuit before issuing their debut single, a rendition of Buddy Holly&apos;s &quot;Not Fade Away,&quot; in 1973. A self-titled LP followed in 1974, at which time Rutsey exited; he was replaced by drummer Neil Peart, who also assumed the role of the band&apos;s primary songwriter, composing the cerebral lyrics (influenced by works of science fiction and fantasy) that gradually became a hallmark of the group&apos;s aesthetic.&#xD;&#xA;With Peart firmly ensconced, the band returned in 1975 with a pair of LPs, Fly by Night and Caress of Steel. Their next effort, 1976&apos;s 2112, proved their breakthrough release: a futuristic concept album based on the writings of Ayn Rand, it fused the elements of the trio&apos;s sound -- Lee&apos;s high-pitched vocals, Peart&apos;s epic drumming, and Lifeson&apos;s complex guitar work -- into a unified whole. Fans loved it -- 2112 was the first in a long line of gold and platinum releases -- while critics dismissed it as overblown and pretentious; either way, it established a formula from which the band rarely deviated throughout the duration of its career.&#xD;&#xA;A Farewell to Kings followed in 1977 and reached the Top 40 in both the U.S. and Britain. After 1978&apos;s Hemispheres, Rush achieved even greater popularity with 1980&apos;s Permanent Waves, a record marked by the group&apos;s dramatic shift into shorter, less sprawling compositions; the single &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; even became a major hit. With 1981&apos;s Moving Pictures, they scored another hit of sorts with &quot;Tom Sawyer,&quot; which garnered heavy exposure on album-oriented radio and became perhaps the trio&apos;s best-known song. As the 1980s continued, Rush grew into a phenomenally popular live draw as albums like 1982&apos;s Signals (which generated the smash &quot;New World Man&quot;), 1984&apos;s Grace Under Pressure, and 1985&apos;s Power Windows continued to sell millions of copies. &#xD;&#xA;As the decade drew to a close, the trio cut back on its touring schedule while hardcore followers complained of a sameness afflicting slicker, synth-driven efforts like 1987&apos;s Hold Your Fire and 1989&apos;s Presto. At the dawn of the &apos;90s, however, Rush returned to the heavier sound of their early records and placed a renewed emphasis on Lifeson&apos;s guitar heroics; consequently, both 1991&apos;s Roll the Bones and 1993&apos;s Counterparts reached the Top Three on the U.S. album charts. In 1996, the band issued Test for Echo and headed out on the road the following summer. Shortly thereafter, Peart lost his daughter in an automobile accident. Tragedy struck again in 1998 when Peart&apos;s wife succumbed to cancer. &#xD;&#xA;Dire times in the Rush camp did not cause the band to quit. Lee took time out for a solo stint with 2000&apos;s My Favorite Headache; however, rumors of the band playing in the studio began to circulate. It would be five years until anything surfaced from the band. Fans were reassured in early 2002 by news that Rush were recording new songs in Toronto. The fruit of those sessions led to the release of Rush&apos;s 17th studio album, Vapor Trails, later that spring. By the end of the year a concert from the supporting tour was released on DVD as Rush in Rio. &#xD;&#xA;In 2004 Rush embarked on their 30th anniversary tour, documented on the DVD R30, and in 2006 they returned to the studio to begin work on a new album. The resulting Snakes &amp; Arrows was released in May 2007, followed by the CD/DVD set Snakes &amp; Arrows Live in early 2008. Material from the latter was combined with footage from Rush in Rio and R30 for the CD/DVD compilation Working Men, which was released in 2009. A documentary on the band assembled by Toronto&apos;s Bangor Productions called Beyond the Lighted Stage appeared in 2010, followed a year later by another Bangor video production, Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland. Rush&apos;s 19th full-length studio album, Clockwork Angels, arrived in June of 2012. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64128/thumb/1445627216" art="/library/metadata/64128/art/1445627216" addedAt="1438447975" updatedAt="1445627216">

  <Directory ratingKey="58898" key="/library/metadata/58898/children" type="artist" title="Santana" summary="Santana is the primary exponent of Latin-tinged rock, particularly due to its combination of Latin percussion (congas, timbales, etc.) with bandleader Carlos Santana&apos;s distinctive, high-pitched lead guitar playing. The group was the last major act to emerge from the psychedelic San Francisco music scene of the 1960s and it enjoyed massive success at the end of the decade and into the early &apos;70s. The musical direction then changed to a more contemplative and jazzy style as the band&apos;s early personnel gradually departed, leaving the name in the hands of Carlos Santana, who guided the group to consistent commercial success over the next quarter-century. By the mid-&apos;90s, Santana seemed spent as a commercial force on records, though the group continued to attract audiences for its concerts worldwide. But the band made a surprising and monumental comeback in 1999 with Supernatural, an album featuring many guest stars that became Santana&apos;s best-selling release and won a raft of Grammy Awards. &#xD;&#xA;Mexican-native Carlos Santana (born July 20, 1947, in Autlan de Navarro, Mexico) moved to San Francisco in the early &apos;60s, by which time he was already playing the guitar professionally. In 1966, he formed the Santana Blues Band with keyboard player and singer Gregg Rolie (born June 17, 1947, in Seattle, Washington) and other musicians, the personnel changing frequently. The group was given its name due to a musicians&apos; union requirement that a single person be named a band&apos;s leader and it did not at first indicate that Carlos was in charge. Bass player David Brown (born February 15, 1947, in New York, New York) joined early on, as did Carlos&apos; high-school friend conga player Mike Carabello (born November 18, 1947, in San Francisco), though he did not stay long at first. By mid-1967, the band&apos;s lineup consisted of Carlos, Rolie, Brown, drummer Bob &quot;Doc&quot; Livingston, and percussionist Marcus Malone. The name was shortened simply to Santana and the group came to the attention of promoter Bill Graham, who gave it its debut at his Fillmore West theater on June 16, 1968. Santana was signed to Columbia Records, which sent producer David Rubinson to tape the band at a four-night stand at the Fillmore West December 19-22, 1968. The results were not released until almost 30 years later, when Columbia/Legacy issued Live at the Fillmore 1968 in 1997. &#xD;&#xA;Livingston and Malone left the lineup in 1969 and were replaced by Carabello and drummer Michael Shrieve (born July 6, 1949, in San Francisco), with a second percussionist, Jose &quot;Chepito&quot; Areas (born July 25, 1946, in Leon, Nicaragua) making Santana a sextet. The band recorded its self-titled debut album and began to tour nationally, making an important stop at the Woodstock festival on August 15, 1969. Santana was released the same month. It peaked in the Top Five, going on to remain in the charts over two years, sell over two million copies, and spawn the Top 40 single &quot;Jingo&quot; and the Top Ten single &quot;Evil Ways.&quot; Santana&apos;s performance of &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; was a highlight of the documentary film Woodstock and its double-platinum soundtrack album, which appeared in 1970. &#xD;&#xA;The band&apos;s second album, Abraxas, was released in September 1970 and was even more successful than its first. It hit number one, remaining in the charts more than a year and a half and eventually selling over four million copies while spawning the Top Five hit &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; and the Top Ten hit &quot;Oye Como Va.&quot; By the end of the year, the group had added a seventh member, teenage guitarist Neal Schon (born February 27, 1954). &#xD;&#xA;Santana&apos;s third album, Santana III, was performed by the seven bandmembers, though several guest musicians were also mentioned in the credits, notably percussionist Coke Escovedo, who played on all the tracks. Released in September 1971, the album was another massive hit, reaching number one and eventually selling over two million copies while spawning the Top Ten hit &quot;Everybody&apos;s Everything&quot; and the Top 20 hit &quot;No One to Depend On.&quot; But it marked the end of the Woodstock-era edition of Santana, which broke up at the end of the tour promoting it, with Carlos retaining rights to the band name. &#xD;&#xA;Following a tour with Buddy Miles that resulted in a live duo album (Carlos Santana &amp; Buddy Miles! Live!), Carlos reorganized Santana and recorded the fourth Santana band album, Caravanserai; each track featured individual musician credits. From the previous lineup, Rolie, Shrieve, Areas, and Schon appeared, alongside pianist Tom Coster, percussionist James Mingo Lewis, percussionist Armando Peraza, guitarist/bassist Douglas Rauch, and percussionist Rico Reyes, among others. (Rolie and Schon left to form Journey.) The album was released in September 1972; it peaked in the Top Five and was eventually certified platinum. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance with Vocal Coloring. Carlos, who had become a disciple of the guru Sri Chinmoy and adopted the name Devadip (meaning &quot;the eye, the lamp, and the light of God&quot;), next made a duo album with John McLaughlin, guitarist with the Mahavishnu Orchestra (Love Devotion Surrender). &#xD;&#xA;Meanwhile, the lineup of Santana continued to fluctuate. On Welcome, the band&apos;s fifth album, released in November 1973, it consisted of Carlos, Shrieve, Areas, Coster, Peraza, Rauch, keyboard player Richard Kermode, and singer Leon Thomas. The album went gold and peaked in the Top 20. In May 1974, Lotus, a live album featuring the same lineup, was released only in Japan. (It was issued in the U.S. in 1991.) Carlos continued to alternate side projects with Santana band albums, next recording a duo LP with John Coltrane&apos;s widow Alice Coltrane (Illuminations). Columbia decided to cash in on the band&apos;s diminishing popularity by releasing Santana&apos;s Greatest Hits in July 1974. The compilation peaked in the Top 20 and eventually went double platinum. &#xD;&#xA;The sixth new Santana album, Borboletta, followed in October. The band personnel for the LP featured Carlos, Shrieve, Areas, Coster, Peraza, a returning David Brown, saxophonist Jules Broussard, and singer Leon Patillo, plus guest stars Flora Purim, Airto Moreira, and Stanley Clarke. Borboletta peaked in the Top 20 and eventually went gold. Carlos steered Santana back to a more commercial sound in the mid-&apos;70s in an attempt to stop the eroding sales of the band&apos;s albums. He enlisted Santana&apos;s original producer, David Rubinson, to handle the next LP. The band was streamlined to a sextet consisting of himself, Coster, Peraza, Brown, drummer Ndugu Leon Chancler (Shrieve having departed to work with Stomu Yamashta), and singer Greg Walker. &#xD;&#xA;The result was Amigos, released in March 1976, which returned Santana to the Top Ten and went gold. The band was back only nine months later with another Rubinson production, Festival, for which Santana consisted of Carlos, Coster, returning members Jose &quot;Chepito&quot; Areas and Leon Patillo, drummer Gaylord Birch, percussionist Raul Rekow, and bass player Pablo Telez. This album peaked in the Top 40 and went gold. Never having issued a live album in the U.S., Santana made up for the lapse with Moonflower, released in October 1977; that band consisted of Carlos, Coster, Areas, Rekow, Telez, returning member Greg Walker, percussionist Pete Escovedo, drummer Graham Lear, and bass player David Margen. The album peaked in the Top Ten and eventually went platinum, its sales stimulated by the single release of a revival of the Zombies&apos; &quot;She&apos;s Not There&quot; that peaked in the Top 20, Santana&apos;s first hit single in nearly six years. &#xD;&#xA;Turning to producers Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter, Santana returned to the studio for Inner Secrets, released in October 1978. The revamped lineup this time was Carlos, Rekow, Walker, Lear, Margen, and returning members Coke Escovedo and Armando Peraza, keyboard player Chris Rhyne, and guitarist/keyboard player Chris Solberg. The album was quickly certified gold, and a revival of the Classics IV hit &quot;Stormy&quot; made the Top 40, but Inner Secrets peaked disappointingly below the Top 20. Once again adopting his guru name of Devadip, Carlos issued his first real solo album (Illuminations/Oneness) in February 1979. Marathon, the tenth Santana band studio album, followed in September, produced by Keith Olsen, the band here comprised Carlos, Rekow, Lear, Margen, Peraza, Solberg, singer Alex Ligertwood, and keyboard player Alan Pasqua. The album equaled the success of Inner Secrets, peaking outside the Top 20 but going gold, with &quot;You Know That I Love You&quot; becoming a Top 40 single. Again, Carlos followed in the winter with another solo effort (The Swing of Delight). &#xD;&#xA;Santana (Carlos, Rekow, Lear, Margen, Peraza, Ligertwood, keyboard player Richard Baker, and percussionist Orestes Vilato) spent some extra time on its next release, not issuing Zebop! until March 1981, and the extra effort paid off. Paced by the Top 20 single &quot;Winning,&quot; the album reached the Top Ten and went gold. The band lavished similar attention on Shango, which was released in August 1982. The same lineup as that on Zebop! was joined by original member Gregg Rolie, who also co-produced the album. A music video helped Santana enjoy its first Top Ten single in more than a decade with &quot;Hold On,&quot; but that did not translate into increased sales for the album, which peaked in the Top 20 but became the band&apos;s first LP not to at least go gold. Carlos followed with another solo album (Havana Moon), but did not release a new Santana band album until February 1985 with Beyond Appearances, produced by Val Garay. By now the lineup consisted of Carlos, Rekow, Peraza, Ligertwood, Vilato, returning member Greg Walker, bass player Alphonso Johnson, keyboard player David Sancious, drummer Chester C. Thompson, and keyboard player Chester D. Thompson. &quot;Say It Again,&quot; the album&apos;s single, reached the Top 40, but that was better than the LP did. &#xD;&#xA;Santana staged a 20-year anniversary reunion concert in August 1986 featuring many past bandmembers. The February 1987 album Freedom marked the formal inclusion of Buddy Miles as a member of Santana, alongside Carlos, Rekow, Peraza, Vilato, Johnson, Chester D. Thompson, and returning members Tom Coster and Graham Lear. The album barely made the Top 100. Carlos followed in the fall with another solo album (Blues for Salvador), winning his first Grammy Award in the process (Best Rock Instrumental Performance for the title track). In 1988, he added Wayne Shorter to the band for a tour, then put together a reunion edition of Santana that featured Areas, Rolie, and Shrieve beside Johnson, Peraza, and Thompson. In October, Columbia celebrated the 20-year anniversary of the band&apos;s signing to the label with the retrospective Viva Santana! The next new Santana album was Spirits Dancing in the Flesh, released in June 1990, for which the band was Carlos, Peraza, Thompson, returning member Alex Ligertwood, drummer Walfredo Reyes, and bass player Benny Rietveld. A modest seller that made only the lower reaches of the Top 100, it marked the end of the band&apos;s 22-year tenure at Columbia Records. &#xD;&#xA;In 1991, Santana signed to Polydor Records, which, in April 1992, released the band&apos;s 16th studio album, Milagro. The lineup was comprised of Carlos, Thompson, Ligertwood, Reyes, Rietvald, and percussionist Karl Perazzo. Polydor was not able to reverse the band&apos;s commercial decline, as the album became Santana&apos;s first new studio release not to reach the Top 100. The group followed in November 1993 with Sacred Fire: Live in South America, which featured Carlos, Thompson, Ligertwood, Reyes, Perazzo, singer Vorriece Cooper, bass player Myron Dove, and guitarist Jorge Santana, Carlos&apos; brother. The album barely made the charts. In 1994, Carlos, Jorge, and their nephew Carlos Hernandez, released Santana Brothers, another marginal chart entry. The same year, Areas, Carabello, Rolie, and Shrieve formed a band called Abraxas and released the album Abraxas Pool, which did not chart. &#xD;&#xA;Santana left Polydor and signed briefly to EMI before moving to Arista, run by Clive Davis, who had been president of Columbia during the band&apos;s heyday. Carlos and Davis put together Supernatural, which was stuffed with appearances by high-profile guest stars including Wyclef Jean, Eric Clapton, Lauryn Hill, Rob Thomas (Matchbox Twenty), and Dave Matthews. Arista released the album in June 1999, followed by the single &quot;Smooth&quot; featuring Thomas. The album and single hit number one and in 2000, a second single, &quot;Maria Maria,&quot; also topped the charts. Supernatural&apos;s sales exploded; its sales exceeded ten million copies. The album garnered 11 Grammy nominations, and Carlos himself took eight awards: Record of the Year (&quot;Smooth&quot;), Album of the Year; Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (&quot;Maria Maria&quot;); Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals (&quot;Smooth&quot;); Best Pop Instrumental Performance (&quot;El Farol&quot;); Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (&quot;Put Your Lights On&quot;); Best Rock Instrumental Performance (&quot;The Calling&quot;); and Best Rock Album. &quot;Smooth,&quot; written by Thomas with Itaal Shur, also won the Grammy for Song of the Year. &#xD;&#xA;The follow-up, Shaman, appeared in 2002 with appearances from Macy Gray, Michelle Branch, and Chad Kroeger (Nickelback), among money others. While it was not a blockbuster on the level of Supernatural, it sold over two million copies in the U.S. Three years later, All That I Am arrived with yet another assortment of collaborators, including Steven Tyler, Branch, Big Boi, Joss Stone, and Bo Bice. Guitar Heaven appeared in 2010 and featured Carlos with several guest vocalists taking on some of the most popular guitar-based rock tracks of all time, including &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; (with Chris Cornell), &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; (with Thomas), and &quot;Photograph&quot; (with Chris Daughtry). While it peaked at number five on the Billboard 200, it failed to reach gold status. In 2012, the guitarist switched gears with Shape Shifter, the debut recording for his own Starfaith label. Carlos wrote or co-wrote all but two of its 13 tracks (all but one an instrumental), and produced the sessions. ~ William Ruhlmann" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58898/thumb/1445624703" art="/library/metadata/58898/art/1445624703" addedAt="1438446865" updatedAt="1445624703">

  <Directory ratingKey="64104" key="/library/metadata/64104/children" type="artist" title="Sarah McLachlan" summary="Since her debut in 1988, Sarah McLachlan&apos;s atmospheric folk-pop has gained a devoted following not only in her native Canada, where she established star status with her first album, but also in the U.S. and U.K. The following two decades saw her growing both as a musician and songwriter, continually redefining herself and emerging as a major voice in the growing adult alternative pop format. She also founded Lilith Fair, a concert tour that helped usher other female songwriters into the mainstream during the late &apos;90s, while maintaining her own presence on the charts.&#xD;&#xA;McLachlan was born on January 28, 1968, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she began taking lessons for voice, classical piano, and guitar as a child. Following a year of art training at the Nova Scotia School of Design, McLachlan (who had also been fronting a new wave band named October Game) was approached by Nettwerk Records and offered a solo deal. She initially turned it down in favor of continued studies; however, she reconsidered and accepted the offer in late 1987, relocating to Vancouver soon after. On the strength of her debut, 1988&apos;s Touch, the budding songwriter was signed to Arista for international distribution. The album eventually reached gold status in Canada and was reissued worldwide in 1989. In 1991, she followed up with Solace, an impressive collection that showed a great leap in songcraft and began to build a strong cult following in the U.S.&#xD;&#xA;In September 1992, following a 14-month promotional tour, McLachlan traveled to Cambodia and Thailand to work on World Vision, a Canadian-sponsored documentary on poverty and child prostitution. Inspired by her experiences, she retreated to a secluded house outside of Montreal to write material for her next album. After six months in a Montreal studio with collaborator/producer Pierre Marchand, she released Fumbling Toward Ecstasy, her strongest and most personal effort to date, in late 1993. The album peaked in the U.S. charts at number 50; by the end of 1994, it reached platinum status after spending 62 weeks on the chart. &quot;Possession,&quot; an atmospheric single that mixed electronica influences with lyrics inspired by a stalker, broke the Top 100 and received considerable airplay, especially on modern rock radio, where it peaked at number 14. &quot;Good Enough&quot; also found a home in that format, reaching number 16. The Freedom Sessions, consisting mainly of alternate versions of tracks from Fumbling, arrived in 1995; that same year also saw the release of &quot;I Will Remember You,&quot; which McLachlan wrote as the theme for Brothers McMullen. Rarities, B-Sides &amp; Other Stuff, a collection of non-LP tracks and remixes, was issued in Canada in 1996. &#xD;&#xA;In 1997, McLachlan began work on her fourth album, the enormously successful Surfacing, which debuted at number two on the pop albums chart. She also organized the Lilith Fair tour, a package tour focusing on emerging women singer/songwriters. Released in 1999, the multi-platinum Mirrorball chronicled McLachlan&apos;s performances on that tour and served as her first live release. In 2003, after a short hiatus from the business, she put out the successful Afterglow, followed by another concert release titled Afterglow Live. Both releases eventually went multi-platinum, and McLachlan continued to tour through 2005. In June of that year, she performed on the Philadelphia stage of Live 8, the multi-city anniversary celebration of Live Aid and G8 summit protest coordinated by Live Aid founder Bob Geldof. She released Bloom, her second remix collection, several months later. While most of its material was drawn from Afterglow, it also included a version of the 1989 McLachlan track &quot;Vox&quot; and a previously unreleased collaboration with DMC and Black Eyed Peas&apos; will.i.am. &#xD;&#xA;McLachlan released two albums in 2006: Mirrorball: The Complete Concert, which captured the entirety of the last date on her 1998 tour, and Wintersong, a collection of traditional and modern Christmas covers (plus one new song, the title cut). She then returned to original material for 2010&apos;s Laws of Illusion, her first studio album in nearly seven years. Featuring âOne Dream,â which she wrote for the 2009 Vancouver Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony, the album was released several weeks before the start of Lilith Fair 2010, the festival&apos;s first appearance in more than a decade. ~ Chris Woodstra" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64104/thumb/1445627120" art="/library/metadata/64104/art/1445627120" addedAt="1438447985" updatedAt="1445627120">

Scissor Sisters (whose name is slang for a lesbian sex act) came from the cutting edge of New York&apos;s nightlife and gay culture, incorporating elements of burlesque and drag shows, as well as performance art, into their theatrical live shows. This was the perfect setting for their music, which gleaned the best of Elton John, the Bee Gees, the B-52&apos;s, David Bowie, and many other artists with a campy sense of humor and impeccable style.&#xD;&#xA;After proving themselves one of the city&apos;s most dynamic live acts, Scissor Sisters won over British and European audiences on a tour early in 2004 that coincided with the release of their self-titled debut album. That March, they returned stateside for a South by Southwest gig with Junior Senior and the B-52&apos;s before returning to the U.K. to tour with Duran Duran in support of the &quot;Take Your Mama Out&quot; single. The band continued to have a busy spring and summer, launching its first U.S. tour in May -- coinciding with the stateside release of Scissor Sisters -- and returning to Europe in June and July. These dates included two gigs supporting Scissor Sisters&apos; spiritual and musical godfather, Elton John, as well as appearances at festivals such as Glastonbury, T in the Park, Roskilde, and the Montreux Jazz Festival. Late that year, Scissor Sisters were nominated for a Grammy for Best Dance Record for &quot;Comfortably Numb.&quot; The band kept busy with touring and producing remixes during 2005, and returned with new material in fall 2006, when the single &quot;I Don&apos;t Feel Like Dancin&apos;&quot; hit number one in England. The band&apos;s subsequent album, Ta-Dah, also topped the charts in Great Britain. In 2008, Paddy Boom left the group and was replaced by Randy Schrager. After completing and then scrapping an entire set of songs, Scissor Sisters worked with producer Stuart Price for their third album, Night Work, which was released in 2010 and preceded by the power ballad &quot;Fire with Fire.&quot; ~ Heather Phares" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60887/thumb/1445625436" art="/library/metadata/60887/art/1445625436" addedAt="1438458020" updatedAt="1445625436">

The two musicians had previously performed together in Mytown, an Irish-based boy band that enjoyed moderate success at home but failed to generate international acclaim. After the group disbanded, Sheehan and O&apos;Donoghue spent several years in Los Angeles, where they worked as producers alongside the likes of Teddy Riley, the Neptunes, and Rodney Jerkins. They later relocated to Dublin and recruited Glen Power as their drummer, trading promising careers in production for a blend of contemporary R&amp;B and polished, anthemic pop/rock. &#xD;&#xA;Forging a unique sound based on a diverse list of influences (including U2, the Neptunes, Timbaland, and Van Morrison), the Script saw their debut single, &quot;We Cry,&quot; receive heavy airplay in both Ireland and Britain, as well as a nod from the influential BBC Radio DJ Jo Whiley. After signing with Phonogenic Records, the group relocated to London and scheduled both a debut album and an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival for summer 2008. Their eponymous debut album proved to be a meteoric success, topping the charts in multiple countries and establishing the Script as 2008&apos;s most popular newcomer. The buzz carried through to 2009, when Paul McCartney and U2 both enlisted the band to open several sold-out shows. &#xD;&#xA;The Script&apos;s sophomore effort, Science and Faith, followed in September of 2010. During the first half of 2012, O&apos;Donoghue helped to further raise the profile of the band when he appeared as a judge alongside Tom Jones, Jessie J, and will.i.am on BBC1&apos;s prime-time talent show The Voice UK.

  <Directory ratingKey="58885" key="/library/metadata/58885/children" type="artist" title="Seal" summary="Seal emerged from England&apos;s house music scene in the early &apos;90s to become the most popular British soul vocalist of the decade. Although his earliest material still showed signs of acid house, by the mid-&apos;90s he had created a distinctive fusion of soul, folk, pop, dance, and rock that brought him success on both sides of the Atlantic.&#xD;&#xA;The son of Nigerian and Brazilian parents, Seal was raised in England. After graduating with an architectural degree, he took various jobs around London, including electrical engineering and designing leather clothing. After a while, he began singing in local clubs and bars. He joined an English funk band called Push, touring Japan with the band in the mid-&apos;80s. When he was in Asia, he joined a Thailand-based blues band. After a short time with that group, he traveled throughout India on his own.&#xD;&#xA;Upon returning to England, Seal met Adamski, a house and techno producer who had yet to make much of an impression within the U.K. Seal provided the lyrics and vocals for Adamski&apos;s &quot;Killer,&quot; which became a number one hit in 1990. After &quot;Killer&quot; became a hit, Seal signed a solo record contract. He recorded his eponymous debut album with Trevor Horn, who had previously worked with ABC, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and the Buggles. The first single pulled from the album, &quot;Crazy,&quot; became a number 15 hit in the U.K. and reached number seven in America upon its release in 1991. Seal was also a success, reaching number 24 in America and selling over three million copies around the world.&#xD;&#xA;After the success of his debut, Seal took three years to complete his second album. In between the two records, he appeared on the Jimi Hendrix tribute album Stone Free, singing on Jeff Beck&apos;s version of &quot;Manic Depression.&quot; In the summer of 1994, he released his second album, which was also titled Seal. Preceded by the American Top 40 hit &quot;Prayer for the Dying,&quot; the album did well upon its release, peaking at number 20 and selling a million copies by the spring of 1995, but it didn&apos;t really take off until a year after its release, when &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to Batman Forever. &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; became a number one pop single in America and spent a total of 12 weeks at the top of the adult contemporary charts; the single spent a total of 45 weeks on the adult contemporary charts. &#xD;&#xA;The success of &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; sent its parent album, Seal, into multi-platinum status; two years after its original release, the album had sold over four million copies in the U.S. alone. Human Being hit the shelves in 1998, with Seal IV following five years later. The career-spanning Best: 1991-2004 appeared in October 2004 with the live CD/DVD combo Live in Paris following a year later. In 2007, Seal returned with the studio full-length System, which featured a duet with his wife, Heidi Klum, whom he married in 2005. His next record, 2008&apos;s Soul, was a switch, featuring covers of classic soul standards. The album was produced by David Foster, who would return for the 2010 release Seal 6: Commitment. Foster was on board again as producer for 2011âs Soul 2, along with Trevor Horn, who also returned to co-produce this second volume of soul covers. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58885/thumb/1445624693" art="/library/metadata/58885/art/1445624693" addedAt="1438451960" updatedAt="1445624693">

  <Directory ratingKey="64089" key="/library/metadata/64089/children" type="artist" title="Seth Lakeman" summary="When the band Equation stumbled to semi-retirement in 2001, Seth Lakeman appeared to be the bandmember least equipped to find solo success. His brothers Sam and Sean teamed up in successful duos with their partners and fellow bandmembers Cara Dillon and Kathryn Roberts, but few imagined the band&apos;s frenzied fiddle player/guitarist would swiftly transform himself into not only one of the hottest talents on the British folk scene, but achieve fame and success well beyond the genre&apos;s parameters. Post-Equation, he played support fiddle behind his sister-in-law Cara Dillon, but back home in the beautiful, dramatic surroundings of Dartmoor in the southwest of England, he was inspired to write songs about the myriad legends and folklore endemic to the mystical countryside in which he was raised. His sole motivation for releasing his first solo album, The Punch Bowl (recorded in brother Sean&apos;s kitchen with other members of Equation and released on his own iScream label in 2002), was to stir up enough interest to get a few folk club gigs. The album sank without a trace. He didn&apos;t have the credibility or a striking enough voice to be taken seriously performing traditional material, and his own songs seemed scarcely original enough to garner attention beyond Equation followers.&#xD;&#xA;Lakeman had little expectation that his second effort, 2004&apos;s Kitty Jay, would fare any better. Again recorded on a shoestring budget (Â£300!) in his brother&apos;s kitchen, it delved further into Devon&apos;s rich legacy of legends and was officially launched with a surreal gig in front of a captive audience at the bleak, intimidating Dartmoor Prison close to his home. But unlike its predecessor, Kitty Jay captured people&apos;s imaginations in unexpected ways. The title track told the harrowing story of a maid who committed suicide when ostracized by the local community after being impregnated by the squire&apos;s son, and inspired a trail of visitors to her roadside grave. Lakeman, meanwhile, found himself the shock inclusion on the short list of the 2005 Mercury Music Prize alongside rock luminaries Coldplay, Kaiser Chiefs, Magic Numbers, Hard-Fi, KT Tunstall, and eventual winners Antony and the Johnsons. Lakeman&apos;s passionate performance of &quot;Kitty Jay&quot; at the finals and his genial, homespun attitude toward the press interest accompanying it helped win a whole new audience, not merely for him, but the folk genre he was representing.&#xD;&#xA;Suddenly Lakeman was the pinup boy of &quot;nu folk,&quot; and although his next album, Freedom Fields, had already been recorded in a similarly modest manner to the previous two, EMI stepped forward in 2006 to sign him to its Relentless imprint and remix and reissue the album. With the full might of a major company behind him, Lakeman was projected into a previously alien world of singles, remixes, videos, daytime TV and radio promotion, and massive tours. He took it all in his stride and relished the chance to create a bigger sound, establishing a band, including brother Sean on guitar and Irish percussionist Cormac Byrne from the Uiscedwr trio playing bodhran.&#xD;&#xA;Achieving mainstream recognition and a couple of minor U.K. hit singles (with &quot;The White Hare&quot; and &quot;Lady of the Sea&quot;), Lakeman&apos;s spectacular rise was greeted with skepticism by a folk world programmed to be suspicious of crossover success. Yet while his style was hardly authentic -- a novel hybrid of traditional song, frothy pop, and classically flavored fiddle playing -- he built an entirely new, young fan base for the music, something many had tried and failed to do before him. He was rewarded with Album of the Year (for Freedom Fields) and Singer of the Year honors at the 2007 BBC Folk Awards, though there was an outcry when the apparently self-written &quot;The White Hare&quot; was nominated as traditional track of the year. His fourth album, Poor Man&apos;s Heaven, arrived in 2008, followed by Hearts &amp; Minds in 2010. Few ever successfully manage to straddle the disparate worlds of pop and folk, but with his infectious energy, original style, and natural charisma, Seth Lakeman kept his balance. ~ Colin Irwin" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64089/thumb/1445627026" art="/library/metadata/64089/art/1445627026" addedAt="1438448010" updatedAt="1445627026">

  <Directory ratingKey="60875" key="/library/metadata/60875/children" type="artist" title="Shakira" summary="After achieving superstardom throughout Latin America, Colombian-born Shakira became Latin pop&apos;s biggest female crossover artist since Jennifer Lopez. Noted for her aggressive, rock-influenced approach, Shakira maintained an extraordinary degree of creative control over her music, especially for a female artist; she wrote or co-wrote nearly all of her own material, and in the process gained a reputation as one of Latin music&apos;s most ambitiously poetic lyricists. When she released her first English material in late 2001, she became an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy video image built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves.&#xD;&#xA;Shakira Mebarak (full name: Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll) was born February 2, 1977, in Barranquilla, Colombia, into a poor family. Her mother was a native Colombian and her father was of Lebanese descent, and so as a child Shakira soaked up music from both cultures; she also listened heavily to English-language rock &amp; roll, listing her favorite bands in later interviews as Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, the Police, the Cure, and Nirvana. Shakira wrote her first song at age eight, began entering (and winning) talent competitions at age ten, and started learning the guitar at age 11 (one story runs that around this age, she was kicked out of her school choir for singing too forcefully). In 1990, at age 13, Shakira moved to BogotÃ¡ in hopes of pursuing a modeling career, but wound up signing a record deal with Sony&apos;s Colombian division instead. Her 1991 debut album, Magia, was comprised of songs she&apos;d written over the past five or six years, including some of her earliest efforts. Although it didn&apos;t break internationally, the record started to make a name for her in her home country. Dissatisfied with the pop inclinations of the follow-up, 1993&apos;s Peligro, Shakira changed direction for a time, joining the cast of the Colombian soap opera El Oasis in 1994.&#xD;&#xA;When Shakira returned to recording in 1995, she asserted more control over the direction of her music and worked more rock &amp; roll rhythms -- as well as occasional Arabic tinges -- into her Latin pop material. The first results were Pies Descalzos, which was initially released in 1995; a slow seller at first, the album gradually caught on thanks to &quot;Estoy Aqui,&quot; which became a hit all over Latin America, as well as Spain. After that breakthrough, Pies Descalzos just kept spinning off singles: &quot;DÃ³nde EstÃ¡s CorazÃ³n?,&quot; &quot;AntologÃ­a,&quot; &quot;Pienso en Ti,&quot; &quot;Un Poco de Amor,&quot; &quot;Se Quiere, Se Mata.&quot; The album hit number one in eight different countries and eventually went platinum in the U.S. as well; Shakira toured for nearly two years promoting it (she finally left El Oasis in 1997).&#xD;&#xA;Seeking to build on her success, Shakira signed Emilio Estefan -- Gloria&apos;s husband and a highly successful music-biz insider -- as her manager and producer. The move paid off when her follow-up album, 1998&apos;s DÃ³nde EstÃ¡n los Ladrones? (Where Are the Thieves?), became an even bigger worldwide hit than its predecessor. What was more, it cracked the lucrative U.S. market wide open, spending 11 weeks at number one on Billboard&apos;s Latin album chart and producing two U.S. number ones (on the Latin chart) with &quot;Ciega, Sordomuda&quot; and &quot;Tu.&quot; The album&apos;s signature track, however, was the worldwide hit &quot;Ojos AsÃ­,&quot; her most explicit nod yet to the Arabic music she&apos;d picked up from her father (not to mention its latent belly dancing connotations). DÃ³nde EstÃ¡n los Ladrones? was also the most effective presentation yet of Shakira&apos;s strong-willed persona; her self-analysis made her even more popular among female fans, while her anger over love gone wrong drew comparisons to Alanis Morissette.&#xD;&#xA;When Gloria Estefan offered to translate &quot;Ojos AsÃ­&quot; into English, the prospect of a crossover suddenly seemed tangible, and Shakira decided that the most effective way to maintain control over her material was to learn English well enough to write in it herself. In the meantime, she set the stage for her crossover bid with a performance on MTV Unplugged, the channel&apos;s first Spanish-language broadcast. MTV Unplugged was released as an album in early 2000, and topped the Latin charts for two weeks on its way to becoming her third straight platinum album; it also won a Grammy for Best Latin Pop Album. At the inaugural Latin Grammy Awards ceremony in 2000, Shakira delivered a much-discussed, show-stopping performance of &quot;Ojos AsÃ­&quot; and took home Unplugged-related trophies for Best Female Pop Vocal (&quot;Ojos AsÃ­&quot;) and Best Female Rock Vocal (&quot;Octavo Dia&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;Mainstream pop stardom beckoned. Shakira dyed her long brown hair blonde, romanced Antonio de la Rua (son of the former president of Argentina), and went to work on her first (mostly) English-language album, Laundry Service. The single/video &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; was released in advance of the album in late 2001, and made her a star in the English-speaking world almost overnight. Laundry Service entered the American pop charts at number three, and &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; climbed into the Top Ten of the singles chart, peaking at number six. The follow-up, &quot;Underneath Your Clothes,&quot; also hit the Top Ten, halting at number nine; less than a year after its release, Laundry Service had gone triple platinum. Reviews of Laundry Service were divided as to the effectiveness of Shakira&apos;s English lyrics, but nearly all agreed on her unique poetic imagery. &#xD;&#xA;Extensive touring to support Laundry Service led to a long break for the singer, so a remix collection (2002&apos;s Laundry Service: Washed and Dried) and a live album (2004&apos;s Live &amp; Off the Record) appeared in lieu of a new album. Revitalized, Shakira began the writing process for her next release and soon had 60 songs ready to go, some in English, some in Spanish; 20 of those songs were selected and divided up by language to make two different albums. Both appeared in 2005 and both hit the Top Ten, with the Spanish-language album Fijacion Oral, Vol. 1 leading the way in June with a number four placing and the English-language album, Oral Fixation, Vol. 2, following in November at number five. As sales of Oral Fixation began to slow in early 2006, Epic reissued the album in March with a bonus track, &quot;Hip Don&apos;t Lie.&quot; The newly recorded song went on to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart in June, becoming one of the summer&apos;s biggest hits and reviving sales of Oral Fixation, as well as Shakira&apos;s entire back catalog.&#xD;&#xA;Shakira signed a ten-year contract with Live Nation in 2008, prompting Forbes to deem her the fourth top-earning female musician in history. She also worked heavily on another album, traveling to multiple cities while collaborating with such producers as RedOne, Wyclef Jean, and Luis F. Ochoa. She Wolf was completed in 2009 and readied for release in October, marking her third English-language album. The electro-disco heavy She Wolf didn&apos;t make many commercial waves, performing well in Europe, Colombia and Mexico but not in the US, yet Shakira quickly bounced back in 2010 with &quot;Waka Waka (This Time for Africa),&quot; the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup that became an international smash hit. On the heels of its success came Sale El Sol in the fall of 2010, an album largely recorded in Spanish that continued her remarkable worldwide success. A live album from Sale El Sol&apos;s supporting tour, Shakira: Live in Paris, appeared in time for the 2011 Christmas season. ~ Steve Huey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60875/thumb/1445625464" art="/library/metadata/60875/art/1445625464" addedAt="1438452972" updatedAt="1445625464">

Signing to Polydor in 1994, Shed Seven&apos;s debut single &quot;Mark&quot;/&quot;Casino Girl&quot; raised few eyebrows, but their second effort, &quot;Dolphin,&quot; reached the UK Top 30; following a third single, &quot;Speakeasy,&quot; the group closed out the year with the release of their debut LP, Change Giver. Although widely dismissed as mere pretenders to the Britpop throne, subsequent Shed Seven singles including &quot;Where Have You Been Lately?&quot; and &quot;Ocean Pie&quot; continued to hit the charts, and although American success was not forthcoming, the quartet achieved megastardom in, of all places, Thailand. Heralded by the hit &quot;Getting Better,&quot; 1996&apos;s Maximum High earned stronger reviews than its predecessor, and after spending much of the next two years on the road, Shed Seven returned in 1998 with Let It Ride; when the album was not a breakout success, Polydor dropped the band soon after. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60870/thumb/1445625404" art="/library/metadata/60870/art/1445625404" addedAt="1438449859" updatedAt="1445625404">

  <Directory ratingKey="64077" key="/library/metadata/64077/children" type="artist" title="Sigur RÃ³s" titleSort="Sigur Ros" summary="Named in part after a sister of one of the bandmembers, Reykjavik, Iceland&apos;s Sigur RÃ³s (Victory Rose) was formed by guitarist and vocalist Jon Thor Birgisson (who later went by the name JÃ³nsi), bassist Georg Holm, and drummer Agust. Formed in early 1994 while the members were teenagers, the trio&apos;s first recorded song earned them a deal with Iceland&apos;s Bad Taste label. Their sprawling debut LP, Von (Hope), was released in 1997, followed the next year by a collection of remixes from that album, Recycle Bin. Kjartan Sveinsson joined the band on keyboards and the band recorded 1999&apos;s strings-heavy ÃgÃ¦tis Byrjun (Good Start), earning themselves numerous accolades in their homeland and achieving platinum status in sales. Agust then departed and was quickly replaced by Orri PÃ¡ll DÃ½Rason. &#xD;&#xA;Svefn-G-Englar, their first release to be distributed outside of their native country, was hailed as NME&apos;s Single of the Week during September of 1999, launching a press hype steamroller in the U.K. and -- to a lesser extent -- in the U.S. The &quot;NÃ½ Battery&quot; single was issued in early 2000, the band&apos;s breakout year. British independent Fat Cat began distributing the band, stretching their reach beyond Icelanders and rabid journalists. April dates in England with Godspeed You! Black Emperor were capped off by an appearance at the All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties festival, and they also opened several dates of Radiohead&apos;s European tour before year&apos;s end.&#xD;&#xA;Sigur RÃ³s spent the first three months of 2001 off the road, setting up their own studio and making their third album. Meanwhile, ÃgÃ¦tis Byrjun found a label in the U.S. and worldwide press became increasingly positive and varied; both Entertainment Weekly and The Wire ran features on the band. The group began touring again in April, playing more shows in Europe, a handful in the States, and several more in Japan throughout the remainder of the year. By the end of the year, ÃgÃ¦tis Byrjun had won the Shortlist Prize for Artistic Achievement in Music; it was also declared Iceland&apos;s Best Album of the Century.&#xD;&#xA;( ), Sigur RÃ³s&apos; third album, was released in 2002. The majority of the material was honed on the road prior to being recorded at Alafoss, the group&apos;s studio, located outside Reykjavik. The album featured a raw sound in comparison to its predecessors and scaled back the extreme highs and lows that were prominent on ÃgÃ¦tis Byrjun. Three years later, they issued 2005&apos;s Takk..., featuring some tighter arrangements and brighter tones. In 2007 they released the documentary film Heima, which chronicled the band&apos;s tour of Iceland the previous year alongside an intimate acoustic show at a coffee shop in the small town of Borg. &#xD;&#xA;Released in 2008, Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust found the group adding fairly straightforward pop songs to its sound alongside the traditionally epic soundscapes. After Sigur RÃ³s completed touring for the album (the final weekend of shows recorded and captured on film and then released in 2011 as Inni), they headed back to the studio but scrapped the results and went on a hiatus. During this time, JÃ³nsi launched a solo career, first collaborating with boyfriend Alex Somers (as JÃ³nsi &amp; Alex) on 2009&apos;s Riceboy Sleeps, then releasing 2010&apos;s Go under his own name. His main claim to fame, though, was recording &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; for the soundtrack of How to Train Your Dragon. &#xD;&#xA;The group ended its hiatus in April of 2010, playing a set at the Coachella Festival. In October of 2011, they released their first live album, Inni, a document of their 2008 tour. Their understated sixth studio album, Valtari (Steamroller), was issued in May of the following year. Following up quickly, Sigur RÃ³s took their sound in a darker, more aggressive direction with their seventh album, Kveikur, which found them boldly pushing their soothing sound in unsettling directions. ~ Andy Kellman" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/64077/thumb/1445627071" art="/library/metadata/64077/art/1445627071" addedAt="1438448023" updatedAt="1445627071">

Skin began singing in high school for a classmate&apos;s band after considering the offer for over a year. Six years after that band broke up, the members of Skunk Anansie (including bass player Cass, guitarist Ace, and drummer Robbie France, who was replaced by Mark Richardson on 1995) met one another by chance. Their name was taken from the West Indian folktales of Anansi the Spider-Man, with a slight change of spelling and &quot;Skunk&quot; added to make the name nastier.&#xD;&#xA;The group played its first gig at London&apos;s Splash club in March 1994, subsequently taking six weeks to record its debut album, Paranoid and Sunburnt, at a &quot;haunted house&quot; outside the city. The band&apos;s first single, &quot;Selling Jesus,&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the film Strange Days; Stoosh followed in 1996, and three years later Skunk Anansie returned with Post Orgasmic Chill. They broke up in 2001, with Skin moving on to a solo career (releasing Fleshwounds in 2003 and Fake Chemical State in 2006). The group re-formed in early 2009, playing sold-out shows and recording three new tracks for a greatest-hits album, Smashes &amp; Trashes. The reunion went so well that they decided to stick together and record a new album, Wonderlustre, released in the autumn of 2010. The track âYou Saved Meâ from the album was used in Zac Synderâs 2011 movie Suckerpunch, as well as their remix of Bjorkâs &apos;Army Of Me&apos;.

  <Directory ratingKey="59820" key="/library/metadata/59820/children" type="artist" title="Smashing Pumpkins" summary="Of all the major alternative rock bands of the early &apos;90s, Smashing Pumpkins were the group least influenced by traditional underground rock. Lead guitarist/songwriter Billy Corgan fashioned an amalgam of progressive rock, heavy metal, goth rock, psychedelia, and dream pop, creating a layered, powerful sound driven by swirling, distorted guitars. Corgan was wise enough to exploit his angst-ridden lyrics, yet he never shied away from rock star posturing, even if he did cloak it in allegedly ironic gestures. In fact, Smashing Pumpkins became the model for alternative rock success. Pearl Jam shunned it and Nirvana was too destructive. The Pumpkins, on the other hand, knew how to play the game, signing to a major-subsidized indie for underground credibility and moving to the major in time to make the group a multi-platinum act. And when the Pumpkins did achieve mass success with 1993&apos;s Siamese Dream, they went a long way to legitimize heavy metal and orchestrated prog rock, helping move alternative rock even closer to &apos;70s AOR, especially in the eyes of radio programmers and mainstream audiences. Unlike many of their contemporaries, they were able to withstand many internal problems and keep selling records, emerging as the longest-lasting and most successful alternative band of the early &apos;90s. &#xD;&#xA;The son of a jazz guitarist, Billy Corgan grew up in a Chicago suburb, leaving home at the age of 19 to move to Florida with his fledgling goth metal band, the Marked. After the band failed down South, he returned to Chicago around 1988, where he began working at a used-record store. At the shop he met James Iha (guitar), a graphic arts student at Loyola University, and the two began collaborating, performing, and recording songs with a drum machine. Corgan met D&apos;Arcy Wretzky at a club show; after arguing about the merits of the Dan Reed Network, the two became friends and she joined the group as a bassist. Soon, the bandmembers, who named themselves Smashing Pumpkins, had gained a dedicated local following, which included the head of a local club who booked them to open for Jane&apos;s Addiction. Before the pivotal concert, the band hired Jimmy Chamberlin, a former jazz musician, as their full-time drummer. &#xD;&#xA;In 1990, Smashing Pumpkins released their debut single, &quot;I Am One,&quot; on the local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single quickly sold out, and in December the band released &quot;Tristessa&quot; on Sub Pop. By this point, Smashing Pumpkins had become the subject of a hot bidding war, and the group latched on to a clever way to move to a major label without losing indie credibility. They signed to Virgin Records, yet it was decided that the group&apos;s debut would be released on the Virgin subsidiary Caroline, and then the band would move to the majors. The strategy worked; Gish, a majestic mix of Black Sabbath and dream pop produced by Butch Vig, became a huge college and modern rock hit upon its spring 1991 release. While it earned a large audience, many indie rock fans began to snipe at Smashing Pumpkins, accusing them of being careerists. Such criticism did the Pumpkins no harm and they embarked on an extensive supporting tour for Gish, which lasted over a year and included opening slots for Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam. During the Gish tour, tensions between bandmembers began to escalate, as Iha and D&apos;Arcy, who had been lovers, went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to drugs and alcohol, and Corgan entered a heavy depression. These tensions hadn&apos;t been resolved by the time the group entered the studio with Vig to record its second album. &#xD;&#xA;Toward the beginning of the sessions, the Pumpkins were given significant exposure through the inclusion of &quot;Drown&quot; on the Singles soundtrack in the summer of 1992. As the sessions progressed, Corgan relieved himself of his depression by working heavily -- not only did he write a surplus of songs, he played nearly all of the guitars and bass on each recording, which meant that its release was delayed several times. The resulting album, Siamese Dream, was an immaculate production owing much to Queen, yet it was embraced by critics upon its July 1993 release. Siamese Dream became a blockbuster, debuting at number ten on the charts and establishing Smashing Pumpkins as stars. &quot;Cherub Rock,&quot; the first single, was a modern rock hit, yet it was &quot;Today&quot; and the acoustic &quot;Disarm&quot; that sent the album into the stratosphere, as well as the group&apos;s relentless touring. Smashing Pumpkins became the headliners of Lollapalooza 1994, and following the tour&apos;s completion, the band went back into the studio to record a new album that Corgan had already claimed would be a double-disc set. To tide fans over until then, the Pumpkins released the B-sides and rarities album Pisces Iscariot in October 1994. &#xD;&#xA;Working with producers Flood and Alan Moulder, Smashing Pumpkins recorded as a full band for their third album, which turned out to be, as Corgan predicted, a double-disc set called Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Although many observers were skeptical about whether a double-disc set, especially one so ridiculously named, would be a commercial success, Mellon Collie became an even bigger hit than Siamese Dream, debuting at number one on the charts. On the strength of the singles &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings,&quot; &quot;1979,&quot; &quot;Zero,&quot; and &quot;Tonight, Tonight,&quot; it sold over four million copies in the U.S., eventually being certified platinum over eight times (each disc in the set counted separately toward certification). The Pumpkins had graduated to stadium shows for the Mellon Collie tour, and the band was at the peak of its popularity when things began to go wrong again. On July 12, prior to two shows at Madison Square Garden, the group&apos;s touring keyboardist, Jonathan Melvoin, died from a heroin overdose; he was with Jimmy Chamberlin, who survived his overdose. In the wake of the tragedy, the remaining Pumpkins fired Chamberlin and spent two months on hiatus as they recovered and searched for a new drummer. Early in August, they announced that Filter member Matt Walker would be their touring drummer and Dennis Flemion, a member of the Frogs, would be their touring keyboardist for the remainder of the year. They returned to the stage at the end of August and spent the next five months on tour. During this time, Corgan contributed some music to Ron Howard&apos;s Ransom. &#xD;&#xA;Early in 1997, once the Pumpkins left the road, Iha and D&apos;Arcy launched Scratchie Records, a subsidiary of Mercury Records. In the spring, Smashing Pumpkins recorded two songs for the soundtrack of Batman &amp; Robin. Iha&apos;s solo debut, Let It Come Down, appeared in early 1998; Adore, the new Smashing Pumpkins LP, followed a few months later to disappointing sales and reviews. Chamberlin returned to the group and D&apos;Arcy exited prior to the early-2000 release of MACHINA: The Machines of God. Several months later, Corgan announced his intentions to dissolve the band before the year was out. With former Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur replacing D&apos;Arcy, the band launched its farewell tour in 2000. Fans received one last treat when Corgan and company worked feverishly to finish off tracks that were left over from the MACHINA sessions. Surprisingly, Virgin Records balked at the idea of releasing the 25-track set so close to the release of their previous album, so the band put the entire album (going by the official title of Machina II: The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music) on the Internet for fans to download for free. On December 2 of the same year, the Pumpkins played a mammoth final show at Chicago&apos;s Metro (also the venue at which the group played its first show back in 1988) before officially calling it quits.&#xD;&#xA;But the former members of the band didn&apos;t wait long before carrying on with other projects -- Corgan spent the summer of 2001 playing guitar with New Order on select concert dates, and later in the year unveiled his new band, Zwan, including Chamberlin on drums (as well as former Chavez guitarist Matt Sweeney and bassist David &quot;Skullfisher&quot; Pajo). The other two former Pumpkins, Iha and Auf der Maur, began putting together an alt-rock supergroup dubbed the Virgins. The same year, a pair of postmortem Pumpkins collections were issued for the holiday season -- a double-disc collection and a DVD both called Greatest Hits. Corgan released his first solo album, The Future Embrace, in 2005, and on the day it came out, he took out a full-page ad in The Chicago Tribune to announce that Smashing Pumpkins were reuniting. He hadn&apos;t informed any of his past bandmates, and only Chamberlin went along. Zeitgeist, a heavier album than any past Pumpkins album, was released in 2007.&#xD;&#xA;Smashing Pumpkins promoted the album heavily well into 2008, but at the end of the year, Corgan announced that the group would no longer record albums, and would instead only issue singles. It wasn&apos;t the only change in the band. Corgan announced the departure of Chamberlin in March 2009, making him the last remaining original member of the band that by then consisted of guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Nicole Fiorentino, and drummer Mike Byrne. Once the dust settled, Corgan followed through on his promise to issue only short-form releases, putting out the track &quot;A Song for a Son&quot; in December of 2009. Scattered songs from the band&apos;s Teargarden by Kaleidyscope concept were released over the next two years as free downloads, with physical collections of the tracks released in 2010 by way of the EP boxed sets Songs for a Sailor and The Solstice Bare. Corgan decided to take a break from the single-centric concept and went into the studio to begin work on 2012&apos;s Oceania, an &quot;album within an album&quot; that would be a part of the 44-track Teargarden concept. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Greg Prato" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/59820/thumb/1445625014" art="/library/metadata/59820/art/1445625014" addedAt="1438448134" updatedAt="1445625014">

  <Directory ratingKey="58857" key="/library/metadata/58857/children" type="artist" title="Snow Patrol" summary="After failing to secure an international audience for nearly ten years, Snow Patrol broke into the mainstream with 2003&apos;s Final Straw, a mega-selling album that showcased the band&apos;s fondness for epic, melancholic rock. The group had originally stuck closer to the pop realm, releasing quirky albums that took more cues from Belle &amp; Sebastian than Coldplay (to whom the band would later draw many comparisons). Final Straw proved to be a turning point, however, paving the way for the success of 2006&apos;s Eyes Open -- particularly its worldwide hit single, &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; -- as well as the band&apos;s future work. &#xD;&#xA;Although originally from Northern Ireland, co-founders Gary Lightbody and Mark McClelland relocated to Scotland during their teenage years to attend college. While studying at the University of Dundee in 1994, they began composing music under several different band names, including Shrug and Polar Bear. The duo eventually adopted the Snow Patrol moniker and enlisted Jonny Quinn to play drums in 1997. One year later, Snow Patrol signed with Jeepster Records, a small label based in London, and released the debut effort Songs for Polar Bears. &#xD;&#xA;Snow Patrol&apos;s audience was modestly growing, and the trio relocated to Glasgow upon graduation. Their second full-length album, When It&apos;s All Over We Still Have to Clear Up, was released in April 2001. Jeepster dropped the band from its roster that same year, however, prompting Lightbody to blow off steam by forming the Reindeer Section, a Scottish supergroup featuring members of Mogwai and Belle &amp; Sebastian. He also continued writing songs for Snow Patrol, including a promising ballad entitled &quot;Run.&quot; After guitarist Nathan Connolly joined the group in 2002, Snow Patrol signed a contract with Fiction Records and began recording a new album alongside producer Chris Lord-Alge. With the power ballad &quot;Run&quot; serving as its lead single, Final Straw became the band&apos;s breakthrough hit, spinning off four Top 40 singles in the U.K. and eventually selling more than four million copies worldwide. &#xD;&#xA;Despite the band&apos;s growing success, founding member Mark McClelland left in March 2005, effectively downgrading Snow Patrol to a trio comprised of Lightbody, Quinn, and Connolly. Shortly thereafter, former Terra Diablo bass player Paul Wilson and touring keyboardist Tom Simpson were permanently added to the lineup, and the group honed its expanded sound by opening shows on the European leg of U2&apos;s Vertigo Tour. Upon the tour&apos;s completion, they returned to the studio and created the slickly commercial Eyes Open, which was released worldwide in May 2006. One year later, with a successful run through North America under their belt and an enduring single, &quot;Chasing Cars,&quot; maintaining their presence on the radio, Eyes Open was certified gold in the United States. It later rose to platinum status, becoming the band&apos;s most successful release in America. Snow Patrol also became the first U.K. rock act in 13 years to break into the Top Five of the Billboard singles charts, a feat they sought to revisit with the release of 2008&apos;s A Hundred Million Suns. &#xD;&#xA;Led by the single &quot;Take Back the City,&quot; A Hundred Million Suns featured an emphasis on positive, romantic lyrics, something that Gary Lightbody had pointedly shunned in the past. The band joined U2 on the road once again, this time playing stadiums in Europe and America during the summer of 2009. Rather than record another album after the tour, however, they chose to release the comprehensive Up to Now, a compilation spanning Snow Patrol&apos;s 15-year history. Lightbody and Simpson also teamed up to compile a mix album, LateNightTales, which featured the band&apos;s own take on INXS&apos; &quot;New Sensation.&quot; Lightbody admitted to a frustrating bout of writer&apos;s block before embarking on the group&apos;s sixth studio album, 2011&apos;s Fallen Empires. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58857/thumb/1445624696" art="/library/metadata/58857/art/1445624696" addedAt="1438456189" updatedAt="1445624696">

  <Directory ratingKey="60846" key="/library/metadata/60846/children" type="artist" title="Soul Asylum" summary="Few bands have had a more complicated relationship with commercial success than Soul Asylum. In the 1980s, they lurked in the shadows of the Minneapolis alternative rock scene, then dominated by the Replacements and HÃ¼sker DÃ¼, and their first tenure on a major label ended with the band being unceremoniously dropped after their expected commercial breakthrough was both a critical and a sales disappointment. In the &apos;90s, they were one of the first underground bands to score a major hit in the wake of Nirvana changing the commercial playing field for alternative rock, but their new popularity cost them the loyalty of their original fan base, and the mass audience soon moved onto other, less emotionally complex acts, leaving Soul Asylum in limbo despite having made several albums of powerful and passionate music, and playing more than 1,000 rollicking, sweat-soaked shows.&#xD;&#xA;Soul Asylum&apos;s story begins in 1981, when three friends from Minneapolis whose loyalties ran to the noisy clamor of punk, the volume and guitar power of hard rock, and the soul-bearing tales of country, decided to form a band. Guitarist Dan Murphy, bassist Karl Mueller, and drummer Dave Pirner began playing out as Loud Fast Rules, with Murphy and Pirner taking turns on vocals. In 1982, the group landed two songs on a cassette-only compilation called Barefoot &amp; Pregnant; the tape was released by Reflex Records, a local label run by HÃ¼sker DÃ¼&apos;s Bob Mould. (Another Reflex collection, Kitten, would feature live material by the group, credited to Proud Crass Fools). In 1983, Pirner moved from drums to lead vocals and rhythm guitar, while Pat Morley took over as percussionist and the band changed their name to Soul Asylum. In 1984, Minneapolis-based Twin/Tone Records signed Soul Asylum, and Bob Mould produced the group&apos;s label debut, a nine-song EP called Say What You Will (it was later expanded into a full-length album with the addition of session outtakes, re-titled Say What You Will, Clarenceâ¦Karl Sold the Truck). Mould also took Soul Asylum on the road as HÃ¼sker DÃ¼ toured in support of their album Flip Your Wig in 1985, exposing the band to larger audiences outside of their home town, and Soul Asylum band began hitting the road with a vengeance as headliners, playing nearly any small club that would have them. The band also gained a new drummer when Grant Young replaced the departing Pat Morley.&#xD;&#xA;When Soul Asylum returned to the studio to record 1986&apos;s Made to Be Broken (with Mould again producing), they were a far stronger and more powerful band, and the album won enthusiastic reviews in the alternative rock press. Another full album, While You Were Out, was released the same year, and their relentless touring schedule was earning the band a loyal and growing audience. By this time, Twin/Tone had struck a deal with A&amp;M Records in which the major label would distribute some of their more successful acts, and in 1988, Soul Asylum were tapped to join the A&amp;M roster. The band celebrated by cutting an EP for their European label, Clam Dip &amp; Other Delights, which parodied the cover of Whipped Cream &amp; Other Delights, the iconic album by A&amp;M founder Herb Alpert; the EP was given a belated stateside release by Twin/Tone in 1989. Shortly after completing Clam Dip, Soul Asylum went into the studio with producer Lenny Kaye, and 1988&apos;s Hang Time was arguably the group&apos;s finest album, with Kaye&apos;s production consolidating the band&apos;s melodic strengths as Soul Asylum delivered a set of strong, powerful performances and emotionally eloquent songs. Hang Time fared well on college radio, and the band toured hard in support, but sales were not much better than the band had managed on Twin/Tone. A&amp;M had greater expectations for their 1990&apos;s And the Horse They Rode in On, produced by Steve Jordan; however, the album, mostly recorded live on a sound stage, failed to capture the band&apos;s on-stage energy, and it was a critical and commercial fizzle. A&amp;M soon dropped the band. &#xD;&#xA;With no record deal and Pirner dealing with hearing problems, Soul Asylum considered breaking up, but after Murphy and Pirner did an acoustic tour as Murphy &amp; Pirfinkle, they began working up new material, and Soul Asylum landed a new record deal with Columbia. When Grave Dancer&apos;s Union arrived in the spring of 1992, the timing was perfect for Soul Asylum; the massive success of Nirvana&apos;s Nevermind, which had topped the charts a few months earlier, made it easier for a band from the indie circuit to get a hearing on radio and MTV, and crunchy but melodic tunes like &quot;Somebody to Shove&quot; and &quot;Black Gold&quot; helped open doors for the band, scoring significant alternative radio airplay and MTV rotation. When the ballad &quot;Runaway Train&quot; was released as the album&apos;s third single, it rose to number five on the Billboard Singles charts and won a Grammy as Best Rock Song; Grave Dancer&apos;s Union went on to sell two million copies. &#xD;&#xA;Having finally achieved stardom, Soul Asylum found it was hard to hold on to. Following extensive touring in support of Grave Dancer&apos;s Union, Grant Young was fired from the band and replaced by journeyman drummer Sterling Campbell; it was later revealed that Campbell had played on several tracks on Grave Dancer&apos;s Union. In 1995, the band released Let Your Dim Light Shine, which was produced by Butch Vig; the alternative music press, who had previously championed the band, displayed little enthusiasm for the newly famous Soul Asylum, and while the album would in time go platinum, it failed to produce a hit along the lines of &quot;Runaway Train,&quot; and was considered a disappointment. The band returned in 1998 with Candy from a Stranger, but the album was savaged by critics and was a flop in the marketplace. Soul Asylum simply sounded tired, and they responded by taking a break. Pirner released a solo album in 2002, and Murphy, who had launched Golden Smog as a side project in 1992, devoted much of 1998 to recording and supporting the second Golden Smog album, Weird Tales. The band played occasional shows, but for the most part they stayed under the radar and seemed to be in no hurry to record again. &#xD;&#xA;In 2004, Soul Asylum reconvened to begin work on a new album, joined by a new drummer, Michael Bland. But sessions came to a halt when bassist Karl Mueller was diagnosed with throat cancer. The Minneapolis music community rallied in support, and a benefit to help with Mueller&apos;s medical expenses made news when Bob Mould and Grant Hart played two songs together, making their first joint appearance since the breakup of HÃ¼sker DÃ¼. However, Mueller lost his battle with cancer on June 17, 2005, and Soul Asylum completed their album, The Silver Lining, with help from several guest musicians, including Tommy Stinson of the Replacements. Columbia/Legacy released The Silver Lining in the summer of 2006; it came and went with little notice, despite a nationwide tour in support (with George Scot McKelvey on bass). Soul Asylum was dropped by Columbia, but in 2009, the band announced they were working on a new album, with Tommy Stinson signing on as their official bassist. In early 2012, Soul Asylum signed with the independent 429 Records label, and the album Delayed Reaction followed that July. ~ Mark Deming" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60846/thumb/1445625392" art="/library/metadata/60846/art/1445625392" addedAt="1438448284" updatedAt="1445625392">

  <Directory ratingKey="60762" key="/library/metadata/60762/children" type="artist" title="The Stands" titleSort="Stands" summary="This Liverpool, England-based indie rock band was formed in 2001 by songwriter Howie Payne (vocals/guitar). Payne had originally performed as a solo act before teaming up with his younger brother Sean Payne (drums), Robbie Stevenson (guitar) and Martin Campbell (bass) to form the Stands. The quartet played their first gig at Liverpoolâs Bandwagon club in December 2001, and after successfully winning over the local crowd began casting around for further live work. The line-up gradually evolved during the following year, and with Payne the focal point he was eventually joined by a stable band featuring Luke Thomson (guitar), Dean Ravera (bass), and Steve Pilgrim (drums).&#xD;&#xD;&#xA;The Stands had completed most of the sessions for their debut album by the time they signed a recording contract with Echo Records, with several tracks recorded at Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagherâs Buckinghamshire studio. Taking overt inspiration from the folk rock style of the Byrds and Bob Dylan, All Years Leaving split critical opinion when it was released in early 2004. âWhen This River Rolls Over Youâ (originally released as a single the previous August) was eerily reminiscent of Dylanâs âIt Ainât Me Babeâ, while âThe Way She Doesâ strayed rather too far into Beatles territory for comfort. However, there was no denying the charm and melodic verve of Payneâs magpie songwriting.&#xD;&#xD;&#xA;The quartetâs second album was recorded in Los Angeles at the Sunset Sound studios. Released in summer 2005, Horse Fabulous gained good reviews but its chances were scuppered when the Echo label ran into financial trouble. The Stands called it a day following a tour to promote the album." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60762/thumb/1445625370" addedAt="1438449566" updatedAt="1445625370">

After an aborted attempt at university life -- he lasted two days -- Fretwell relocated to Manchester, where his clear northern voice, poetic lyrics, and melodic guitar work soon won him an audience.

(born Rob Birch) and DJ/producer the Head (Nick Hallam) formed the Gee Street label as a means of promoting their music. Gee Street soon signed a distribution deal with the New York-based 4th &amp; Broadway label, and a series of singles followed before Stereo MC&apos;s&apos; debut album, 33-45-78, surfaced in 1989.&#xD;&#xA;After the departure of founding member Cesare, the group -- now consisting of Rob B., the Head, drummer Owen If (born Owen Rossiter), and vocalist Cath Coffey -- issued the 1990 single &quot;Elevate My Mind,&quot; which became the first British rap single ever to reach the U.S. pop charts. Following the release of the album Supernatural, Stereo MC&apos;s toured with the Happy Mondays and EMF before returning to the studio to record their 1992 breakthrough Connected, a sample-free album recorded completely with live instruments which spawned major hits like &quot;Step It Up,&quot; &quot;Creation,&quot; &quot;Ground Level,&quot; and the title track. Throughout several years of production and remix work, the group&apos;s long-awaited (and oft-delayed) follow-up remained unreleased, though in 1997, Coffey did at least issue her debut solo single, &quot;Wild World.&quot; For their 2000 mix album DJ Kicks, Stereo MC&apos;s recorded three new tracks, &quot;Rhino, Pts. 1-3,&quot; and finally in 2001 issued a new album, Deep Down &amp; Dirty, after a long nine-year hiatus. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63969/thumb/1445626970" art="/library/metadata/63969/art/1445626970" addedAt="1438448158" updatedAt="1445626970">

Originally from London, England, Douwma is a self-taught producer who began producing music on his PC at age 13 and attained his know-how from software manuals. One of his demos eventually made its way into the hands of Andy C., the co-founder of Ram Records, one of the U.K.&apos;s premier drum&apos;n&apos;bass labels. Signed initially to the Ram Records offshoot label Frequency, Douwma made his recording debut as Sub Focus in 2003 with the 12&quot; release Down the Drain/Hot Line. A couple more 12&quot; releases on Frequency followed in 2004, along with one on J Majik&apos;s Infrared label. Douwma&apos;s breakout year came in 2005, however, when he made his Ram Records debut, releasing X-Ray/Scarecrow and, later in the year, Frozen Solid/Juno; these 12&quot; releases were also compiled on the Frozen Solid/X-Ray maxi-single in response to their widespread demand, as &quot;X-Ray&quot; was awarded Single of the Week on tastemaker Zane Lowe&apos;s BBC Radio 1 show. Also in 2005, Douwma was chosen to remix the Prodigy&apos;s &quot;Smack My Bitch Up&quot; in promotion of the group&apos;s 15-year anniversary collection, Their Law: The Singles 1990-2005.&#xD;&#xA;In subsequent years, Douwma continued his affiliation with Ram Records, releasing a 12&quot; more or less annually (i.e., Airplane/Flamenco, 2006; Special Place/Druggy, 2007; Time Warp/Join the Dots, 2008; et al.) and performing as an affiliate DJ at clubs such as Fabric and festivals such as Glastonbury. In 2009 Douwma issued his full-length debut, Sub Focus, which incorporated an eclectic fusion of futuristic house, dubstep, and electro-rock. The following year he produced the track &quot;Kickstarts&quot; for British singer/rapper Example, which peaked at number three on the U.K. singles chart, and in 2011 he inked a deal with Mercury, with plans to release his second album under the Sub Focus moniker in late 2012. The album sessions went on longer than expected and spawned five singles which gained Douwma increasing recognition and success with each release, culminating in the euphoric UK no. 10 hit &quot;Endorphins&quot; featuring vocalist Alex Clare. The success of the single was no doubt powered at least in part by its brilliant music video, which sees brutal riot police cracking down on dissidents in a dystopian future where music has been banned. A number of other high-profile vocalists, including Bloc Party&apos;s Kele Okereke, appeared on the eventual album, which was titled Torus and released in September 2013. ~ Jason Birchmeier" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/63944/thumb/1445626944" art="/library/metadata/63944/art/1445626944" addedAt="1438448174" updatedAt="1445626944">

  <Directory ratingKey="58735" key="/library/metadata/58735/children" type="artist" title="Sugababes" summary="Multi-ethnic U.K. trio Sugababes jumped aboard the teen pop bandwagon prior to the new millennium and exuded their own sassy demeanor without the frivolity of most mainstream acts. Siobhan Donaghy, Keisha Buchanan, and Mutya Buena were barely in their teens when they formed in 1998, sharing a liking of garage, hip-hop, and dance music. Initially, Sugababes were three friends who enjoyed singing along to the radio. Buchanan and Buena had been pals since primary school, and a chance meeting with Donaghy molded a fierce bond. A career in music wasn&apos;t intentional, yet a deal with London surfaced in 2000. Studio time with producer Cameron McVey (All Saints, Pete Tong) led to One Touch, which was released during the summer of 2001 and featured a dozen tracks co-written by the girls, including the smash hit &quot;Overload.&quot; Sales didn&apos;t meet London&apos;s expectations. The group was subsequently dropped. &#xD;&#xA;During the fall of 2001, rumors swirled about Donaghy&apos;s departure. Buena and Buchanan denied that Donaghy was kicked out of the group, but she was nonetheless gone after a four-year run. Heidi Range, one of the pre-chart members of Atomic Kitten, became her replacement, and Angels with Dirty Faces -- the group&apos;s second album -- was released through a new deal with Island by the end of 2002. The Richard X-produced &quot;Freak Like Me,&quot; a cover of Adina Howard&apos;s 1995 R&amp;B hit that featured a bolstered version of Tubeway Army&apos;s &quot;Are Friends Electric&quot; as its backdrop, debuted as a number one hit in the U.K. The Xenomania-produced &quot;Round Round&quot; followed suit with identical success. &#xD;&#xA;Three, released in late 2003, fittingly topped out at number three on the U.K. album chart. It spawned another U.K. number one, &quot;Hole in the Head,&quot; which even managed to scrape the Hot 100 in the U.S. and hit the top of the same country&apos;s dance chart. Amazingly, the group was never given much of a push stateside. Taller in More Ways, the fourth album, followed roughly two years later and eclipsed the group&apos;s already successful run by reaching the top of the U.K. album chart. Shortly after its release, Buena left the group on good terms, citing personal reasons. Amelle Berrabah&apos;s entry into the group prompted a re-release of Taller that featured her vocals on a handful of cuts; Buena&apos;s work was left intact on a few others, and the album eventually gained platinum status. Overloaded: The Singles Collection was out by the end of 2006. Change, an album that contained the chart-topping single &quot;About You Now,&quot; was released in 2007, and it was followed by 2008&apos;s Catfights and Spotlights. &#xD;&#xA;Prior to completing 2010&apos;s Sweet 7, Buchanan was removed from the group and subsequently replaced by Jade Ewen, who had competed unsuccessfully as the British entrant in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest. Sugababes&apos; lineup no longer featured any of the original membership. Despite all the negative publicity and an upset fan base, a handful of singles off Sweet 7 reached the U.K. Top Ten. In 2011, the trio began sessions for their eighth release and in the same year ended their long-term relationship with Island Records in favor for a deal with Sony Musicâs RCA. Progress on the record was curtailed in 2012 when the group went on hiatus and chose to concentrate on solo projects, which included Rangeâs appearance on British TV series Dancing on Ice while Berrabah worked on her solo career. ~ MacKenzie Wilson &amp; Andy Kellman" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58735/thumb/1445624660" art="/library/metadata/58735/art/1445624660" addedAt="1438448192" updatedAt="1445624660">

  <Directory ratingKey="58714" key="/library/metadata/58714/children" type="artist" title="Take That" summary="As the most popular teen pop sensation in Britain since the &apos;60s, Take That ruled the U.K. charts during the first half of the &apos;90s. In strict commercial terms, the band sold more records than any English act since the Beatles, though the cultural and musical importance was significantly less substantial. Conceived as a British answer to New Kids on the Block, Take That initially worked the same territory as their American counterparts, singing watered-down new jack R&amp;B, urban soul, and mainstream pop. Eventually, the group worked its way toward Hi-NRG dance music, while also pursuing an adult contemporary ballad direction. Take That&apos;s boyish good looks guaranteed them a significant portion of the teenybopper audience, but in a bizarre twist, most of their videos and promotional photos had a strong homosexual undercurrent -- they were marketed to preteen girls and a kitschy gay audience simultaneously. &#xD;&#xA;Take That were also able to make inroads in the adult audience in Britain through Gary Barlow&apos;s melodic, sensitive ballads. For nearly five years, Take That&apos;s popularity was unsurpassed in Britain, as they racked up a total of seven number one hits. By the middle of the decade, however, all of the members were entering their mid-twenties and became disenchanted with each other. Furthermore, the pop music tastes in Britain were shifting toward the classic guitar pop sounds of Brit-pop bands like Blur and Oasis, who were able to appeal to both the indie rock and teen pop audience. Consequently, the group called it quits in 1996, as Oasis began to surpass Take That both in terms of sales and cultural impact. Nevertheless, Take That remained one of the most interesting and popular British teen pop phenomena of the &apos;90s, and a reunion in 2005 helped rejuvenate the group&apos;s commercial success.&#xD;&#xA;Gary Barlow (born January 20, 1971) was always the central figure of Take That, serving as both lead vocalist and chief songwriter. Barlow had spent his childhood focused on music, and by the age of 14, he was playing organ in Ken Dodd&apos;s supporting band. One of Barlow&apos;s first songs, &quot;Let&apos;s Pray for Christmas,&quot; was a finalist in an original Christmas song competition on the BBC television show Pebble Mill. In his late teens, he came in contact with Mark Owen (born January 27, 1974) and Robbie Williams (born February 13, 1974), two other young musicians who came from middle-class backgrounds. Williams&apos; father was a comedian and his mother was a singer; before the formation of Take That, he had briefly appeared in the British soap opera Brookside. Meanwhile, Owen had previously auditioned and failed for the football team Manchester United. The trio formed the Cutest Rush, which had a short-lived career. &#xD;&#xA;Record producer/manager Nigel Martin Smith had the intention of putting together a British pop group in the vein of New Kids on the Block, and approached the members of the Cutest Rush. Barlow, Owen, and Williams agreed, and along with Jason Orange (born July 10, 1970) and Howard Donald (born April 28, 1968) -- two former members of a breakdancing troupe called Street Beat -- they became Take That in 1990. After a few brief tours through gay English nightclubs, Take That released their debut single, &quot;Do What U Like,&quot; on their independent Dance U.K. label in July of 1991. &quot;Do What U Like&quot; became a minor sensation, primarily because the video was quite suggestive and featured the band&apos;s bare behinds. The single caused enough uproar for RCA Records to sign the group in the fall of 1991, and their first single for the label, &quot;Promises,&quot; scraped the Top 40 by the end of the year. In early 1992, Take That underwent a Safe Sex club tour to support their third single, &quot;Once You&apos;ve Tasted Love,&quot; but the record only reached number 47. &#xD;&#xA;The band didn&apos;t break into the big time until that summer, when its cover of Tavares&apos; &quot;It Only Takes a Minute&quot; reached number seven. Following the single&apos;s success, Take That became a British media sensation, thus setting the stage for the group&apos;s debut, Take That and Party, to land a chart position of number five upon its release in the fall. Within a month, the single &quot;A Million Love Songs&quot; reached the Top Ten. At the end of the year, the group took home no less than seven awards at the Smash Hits Awards, and the debut continued to climb the charts, peaking at number two. Early in 1993, the group&apos;s number three cover of Barry Manilow&apos;s &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot; won a Brit Award for Best British single; shortly afterward, &quot;Why Can&apos;t I Wake Up with You&quot; reached number two.&#xD;&#xA;Despite their massive success in Britain, the American release of Take That&apos;s debut in early 1993 went virtually unnoticed, even though it was supported with a marketing campaign that placed the band on cereal boxes. Their lack of American success went unnoticed, however, when &quot;Pray,&quot; the first single from their forthcoming second album, entered the charts at number one. In the fall, &quot;Relight My Fire,&quot; which featured a cameo from Lulu, reached number one. Everything Changes, the band&apos;s second album, entered the charts at number one upon its October release. Throughout the end of 1993 and 1994, Everything Changes yielded hit singles, with the majority of the releases making their way to number one. Though it was a huge success in the U.K., Canada, and Europe, the album was never released in the United States. &#xD;&#xA;As Take That were preparing their third album, Britain&apos;s musical tastes were beginning to change, shifting away from the group&apos;s trademarked lightweight dance-pop and toward classic British guitar pop. Blur, Oasis, and Pulp became serious contenders for the popularity of Take That, who didn&apos;t ignore the threat -- they just responded to it in different ways. Gary Barlow plowed ahead with Take That, and the first single from the forthcoming third album, &quot;Back for Good,&quot; was more substantive than any of their previous singles and earned them good reviews from all quarters of the press. However, the single suggested that Barlow was beginning to distance himself from the band -- and he wasn&apos;t the only member to act in such a manner. &#xD;&#xA;In particular, Robbie Williams was becoming known as the &quot;wild&quot; member, and was alienating himself from the rest of the group. Nobody Else, the band&apos;s third album, was a number one hit upon its spring release, yet Williams was noticeably quiet on the record. During the summer of 1995, it became evident that he was getting ready to break away from Take That. Williams began tagging along after Oasis, who were notorious for their drug and alcohol intake. He became the target of a number of tabloid reports about his bad behavior, and he began bragging to the weekly music press that he was working on solo material that sounded like Oasis. So it didn&apos;t really come as a surprise when he left the group in July of 1995, announcing that he was working on a solo album. Following his departure, Take That immediately removed his name and likeness from all promotional and commercial material; his face didn&apos;t even appear on the cover of the American release of Nobody Else.&#xD;&#xA;Williams wasn&apos;t the only member of the group feeling the pinch of the Brit-pop revolution. Since all the members of Take That were young men in their mid-twenties, searching for their own identities and desperate to retain credibility, they were beginning to feel uncomfortable with the shiny, polished pop that their group had trademarked -- all of the members, that is, except Gary Barlow, who had decided that he was the heir to the throne Elton John and George Michael once held. As the group was unraveling, &quot;Back for Good&quot; was taking off on American radio, getting heavy airplay on adult contemporary and Top 40 radio stations, as well as MTV, which helped set the stage for a solo career that Barlow was clearly planning. &#xD;&#xA;So, it didn&apos;t really come as a surprise when Take That announced they had broken up on February 13, 1996. Following the press release, Take That released a greatest-hits collection, with their final single, a cover of the Bee Gees&apos; &quot;How Deep Is Your Love?,&quot; entering the charts at number one. Barlow began working with a batch of professional songwriters, including Diane Warren, releasing a single in the summer that showcased a more mature side of the singer. It stalled at number two, being kept out of the pole position by Spice Girls, a dance-pop group that was touted as the female Take That. Mark Owen, for his part, began working on a solo album that was heavily influenced by Paul Weller and Radiohead. Orange and Donald declined to begin solo careers.&#xD;&#xA;And Williams? He released his first solo single in the summer of 1996, and despite his initial reports, it didn&apos;t sound a thing like Oasis. Rather, it was a cover of George Michael&apos;s &quot;Freedom 90&quot; that quickly fell off the charts. Williams soon recovered, though, and his accompanying 1997 solo album, Life Thru a Lens, became a chart-topping hit in Britain. A year later, he released the equally successful I&apos;ve Been Expecting You. Despite his superstar status in the U.K., numerous efforts to break his career in the States (beginning with the 1999 U.S.-only compilation The Ego Has Landed) failed to grab American audiences. Nonetheless, Williams remained a hugely popular performer in Europe, releasing chart-topping album after chart-topping album.&#xD;&#xA;In 2005, the Take That compilation Never Forget: The Ultimate Collection, which also featured the previously unrecorded Barlow composition &quot;Today I&apos;ve Lost You,&quot; was released to fairly respectable chart success. A television documentary and reunion tour (minus Williams) followed and helped whet audience appetites for future Take That projects. In 2006, Take That released Beautiful World, their fourth studio effort and first full-length album of new material since disbanding in 1996. The album showcased the band&apos;s updated, mature approach but retained enough of Take That&apos;s signature sound to appeal to longtime fans. Beautiful World sold extremely well, moving over three million copies worldwide and going eight times platinum in the U.K. The band also garnered a Brit Award for Best British Single for the song &quot;Patience,&quot; and Take That&apos;s career resurgence continued with the release of The Circus two years later. The album&apos;s leadoff track, &quot;The Greatest Day,&quot; quickly shot to number one on the U.K. singles charts, and the album sold over 133,000 copies in Britain during its first day of release. The Circus also generated a successful live spin-off in the December 2009 set The Greatest Day -- Take That Present: The Circus Live.&#xD;&#xA;Robbie Williams unexpectedly returned to the Take That fold in 2010, his presence dominating the acclaimed and successful reunion album Progress. Take That supported the album -- which sold 235,000 copies on the first day of its U.K. release -- with a major tour. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58714/thumb/1445624651" art="/library/metadata/58714/art/1445624651" addedAt="1438456722" updatedAt="1445624651">

The Temper Trap released their debut EP that same year, and word of the group&apos;s potential soon spread to other continents. Veteran British producer Jim Abbiss (who previously worked on the Arctic Monkeys&apos; debut) saw enough promise in the Temper Trap&apos;s material to fly to Australia, where he gathered the musicians into Melbourne&apos;s Sing Sing Studios and helped ready their debut album, Conditions, for a 2009 release. &#xD;&#xA;&quot;Sweet Disposition,&quot; a U2-styled anthem, was released that September as the band&apos;s first single. It cracked the Top 40 in multiple countries and appeared in the Zooey Deschanel film (500) Days of Summer, which helped the band increase its following in America. The Temper Trap responded by touring heavily, making stops at festivals like Glastonbury and Bonnaroo along the way. They also reached out to a number of DJs, producers, and bands, asking them to remix material from the group&apos;s debut.

Musically, John Flansburgh and John Linnell borrowed from everywhere, but their freewheeling eclecticism was enhanced by their arcane, geeky sense of humor. The duo would reference everything from British Invasion to Tin Pan Alley, while making allusions to pulp fiction and President Polk. Through their string of indie releases and constant touring, They Might Be Giants built up a huge following on college campuses during the late &apos;80s, switching to a major label in the early &apos;90s. With support from MTV, 1990&apos;s Flood became a gold album, and with it, the duo began to reap commercial rewards, moving into the status of one of the most popular alternative bands before grunge. However, They Might Be Giants&apos; whimsical outlook became buried in the avalanche of post-grunge groups that dominated MTV and modern rock radio in the mid-&apos;90s, and the group retreated to its cult following.&#xD;&#xA;Flansburgh and Linnell met when they were children in Lincoln, Massachusetts. During high school, they began writing songs together, yet they never officially formed a band. Both Johns went to college after high school, with Linnell playing in the Mundanes, a new wave group from Rhode Island. By 1981, the pair had reunited, deciding to move to Brooklyn to pursue a musical career. Taking their name from a George C. Scott film and performing their original material with a drum machine, They Might Be Giants soon became fixtures on the Manhattan underground. Although Flansburgh and Linnell were building a cult following, they had a hard time getting a record deal, so they set up Dial-A-Song -- a phone line that played songs on an answering machine -- as a way to get their songs heard. The gimmick worked. Not only did it lead to a deal with the indie label Bar/None, but over the years it was a successful venture; at one point, the service was receiving hundreds of calls a day.&#xD;&#xA;They Might Be Giants released their eponymous debut in 1986, and the album became a college radio hit; it also made waves on MTV due to the inventive video for &quot;Don&apos;t Let&apos;s Start.&quot; Two years later, they released Lincoln, which expanded their following considerably. Featuring the college hit &quot;Ana Ng,&quot; Lincoln climbed to number 89 on the charts, earning the attention of major labels. They Might Be Giants decided to sign with Elektra Records in 1990, releasing Flood later that year. Flood worked its way to gold status, thanks to the singles &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; and &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople),&quot; which both had popular videos. In the wake of the group&apos;s success, Restless/Bar/None released the B-sides and rarities compilation Miscellaneous T in 1991.&#xD;&#xA;Apollo 18, released in 1992, wasn&apos;t quite as successful as Flood, yet it consolidated the group&apos;s cult. For the album&apos;s supporting tour, They Might Be Giants performed with a full backing band for the first time, hiring former Pere Ubu bassist Tony Maimone and drummer Brian Doherty. The shift toward a full band coincided with the dominance of grunge in alternative rock. Though they were strengthened by the powerful sound of a full band, They Might Be Giants failed to receive much attention from MTV, mainstream modern rock radio, or college radio when they released John Henry in the fall of 1994. Recorded with the full band, John Henry lost the group a number of fans, yet their concerts remained popular attractions, especially on American college campuses. Still, the band&apos;s next album, 1996&apos;s Factory Showroom, was virtually ignored by the press, MTV, and radio. The live Severe Tire Damage followed two years later. &#xD;&#xA;They Might Be Giants maintained their &quot;hardest working men in show business&quot; status in 2001 when they issued Mink Car, a stunning follow-up to Factory Showroom that boasted collaborations with M. Doughty, Adam Schlesinger, and the Elegant Too. They celebrated their 20th anniversary in summer 2002 with the release of their first children&apos;s album, No! Rhino also celebrated the band&apos;s tenure with the first-ever They Might Be Giants retrospective, Dial-A-Song: 20 Years of They Might Be Giants. A year later, Flansburgh and Linnell joined Canadian artist Marcel Dzama for the children&apos;s book and CD set Bed, Bed, Bed. The Indestructible Object EP arrived in spring 2004, just a few months before the band&apos;s eighth full-length album, The Spine. Early in 2005, Here Come the ABCs and its accompanying DVD were the band&apos;s first releases for Disney Sound. Later that year, They Got Lost arrived. &#xD;&#xA;Over the course of the next two years, TMBG released a series of monthly and bimonthly podcasts. They also contributed to various film soundtracks, including Disney&apos;s Meet the Robinsons and the film adaptation of Neil Gaiman&apos;s Coraline. The band&apos;s 14th studio release, The Else, hit stores in the summer of 2007. Here Come the 123&apos;s, the sequel to Here Come the ABC&apos;s, appeared in early 2008. Later that year, the CD/DVD set Venue Songs, which featured appearances by actor/comedian John Hodgman, was released. Here Comes Science, which featured songs about paleontology, astronomy, and chemistry, and included a DVD with animated versions of &quot;the Johns&quot; and videos by Divya Srinivasan, Tiny Inventions, David Cowles, Hine Mizushima, and Feel Good Anyway, was released in fall 2009. Two years later, They Might Be Giants put the children&apos;s music on hold and released Join Us, the band&apos;s first &quot;adult&quot; album in four years. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/62020/thumb/1445625917" art="/library/metadata/62020/art/1445625917" addedAt="1438448454" updatedAt="1445625917">

  <Directory ratingKey="60718" key="/library/metadata/60718/children" type="artist" title="Thomas Dolby" summary="Though he never had many hits, Thomas Dolby became one of the most recognizable figures of the synth pop movement of early-&apos;80s new wave. This was largely due to his skillful marketing. Dolby promoted himself as a kind of mad scientist, an egghead who had successfully harnessed the power of synthesizers and samplers and used them to make catchy pop and light electro-funk. Before he launched a solo career, Dolby had worked as a studio musician, technician, and songwriter; his most notable work as a songwriter was &quot;New Toy,&quot; which he wrote for Lene Lovich, and Whodini&apos;s &quot;Magic&apos;s Wand.&quot; In 1981 he launched a solo career, which resulted in a number of minor hits and two big hits: &quot;She Blinded Me with Science&quot; (1982) and &quot;Hyperactive&quot; (1984). Following &quot;Hyperactive,&quot; his career faded away, as he began producing more frequently, as well as exploring new synthesizer and computer technology. Dolby continued to record into the &apos;90s, but by that time, he was strictly a cult act.&#xD;&#xA;Dolby&apos;s interest in music arose through his interest in computers, electronics, and synthesizers. The son of a British archaeologist, Thomas Dolby (b. Thomas Morgan Robertson, October 14, 1958) originally attended college to study meteorology, but he was soon sidetracked by electronics, specifically musical equipment. He began building his own synthesizers when he was 18 years old. Around the same time, he began to learn how to play guitar and piano, as well as how to program computers. Eventually, his schoolmates gave him the nickname of &quot;Dolby,&quot; which was the name for a noise-reduction technology for audiotapes; he would eventually take the nickname as a stage name.&#xD;&#xA;In his late teens, Dolby was hired as a touring sound engineer for a variety of post-punk bands, including the Fall, the Passions, and the Members; on these dates, he would use a PA system he had built himself. In 1979 he formed the arty post-punk band Camera Club with Bruce Woolley, Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes, and Matthew Seligman. Within a year, he had left the group and joined Lene Lovich&apos;s backing band. Dolby gave Lovich his song &quot;New Toy,&quot; which became a British hit in 1981. That same year he released his first solo single, &quot;Urges,&quot; on the English independent label Armageddon. By the fall he had signed with Parlophone and released &quot;Europa and the Pirate Twins,&quot; which nearly cracked the U.K. Top 40.&#xD;&#xA;Dolby started playing synthesizer on sessions for other artists in 1982. That year he appeared on Foreigner&apos;s 4, Def Leppard&apos;s Pyromania, and Joan Armatrading&apos;s Walk Under Ladders. Also in 1982, he wrote and produced &quot;Magic&apos;s Wand&quot; for Whodini; the song became one of the first million-selling rap singles. Even with all of these achievements, 1982 was most noteworthy for the release of Dolby&apos;s first solo album, The Golden Age of Wireless, in the summer of 1982; the record reached number 13 in England, but was virtually forgotten in America. &quot;Windpower,&quot; the first single from the record, became his first Top 40 U.K. hit in the late summer.&#xD;&#xA;In January of 1983 Dolby released an EP, Blinded by Science, which included a catchy number called &quot;She Blinded Me with Science&quot; that featured a cameo vocal appearance by the notorious British eccentric Magnus Pike, who also appeared in the song&apos;s promotional video. Blinded by Science was a minor hit in England, but the EP and the single became major American hits in 1983, thanks to MTV&apos;s heavy airplay of the &quot;She Blinded Me with Science&quot; video. Eventually, the song reached number five on the U.S. charts and it was included on a re-sequenced and reissued version of The Golden Age of Wireless, which peaked at number 13 in America.&#xD;&#xA;The Flat Earth, Dolby&apos;s second album, appeared in early 1984 and was supported by the single &quot;Hyperactive.&quot; The single became his biggest U.K. hit, peaking at number 17. Though The Flat Earth reached number 35 on the U.S. charts, Dolby&apos;s momentum was already beginning to slow: none of the singles released from the album cracked the American Top 40. Nevertheless, Dolby was in demand as a collaborator and he worked with Herbie Hancock, Howard Jones, Stevie Wonder, George Clinton, and Dusty Springfield. In 1985 he produced Clinton&apos;s Some of My Best Jokes Are Friends, Prefab Sprout&apos;s Steve McQueen (Two Wheels Good in the U.S.), and Joni Mitchell&apos;s Dog Eat Dog, as well as supporting David Bowie at Live Aid. Also in 1985, he began composing film scores, starting with Fever Pitch. In 1986 he composed the scores for Gothic and Howard the Duck, to which he credited himself as Dolby&apos;s Cube. That credit led to a lawsuit from the Dolby Labs, who eventually prohibited the musician from using the name &quot;Dolby&quot; in conjunction with any other name than &quot;Thomas.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;Aliens Ate My Buick, Dolby&apos;s long-delayed third album, appeared in 1988 to poor reviews and weak sales, even though the single &quot;Airhead&quot; became a minor British hit. That same year, Dolby married actress Kathleen Beller. For the rest of the late &apos;80s and early &apos;90s, he continued to score films, producing and building his own computer equipment. His fourth album, Astronauts &amp; Heretics, was released in 1992 on his new label, Giant. Despite the presence of guest stars like Eddie Van Halen, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, and Ofra Haza, the album was a flop. The following year Dolby founded the computer software company Headspace, which released The Virtual String Quartet as its first program. For the rest of the &apos;90s, Headspace occupied most of Dolby&apos;s time and energy. In 1994 he released The Gate to the Mind&apos;s Eye, a soundtrack to the videotape Mind&apos;s Eye. Also that year, Capitol released the greatest-hits collection Retrospectacle. &#xD;&#xA;In 2003 he released the live album Forty, originally issued as a limited-edition, home-packaged, signed and numbered release (of which only 1,000 were pressed), although it was later pressed as a readily available CD. A tour of America would be documented on The Sole Inhabitant Live Concert, released in 2006. In 2009 The Singular Thomas Dolby collection would be released in conjunction with expanded reissues of The Golden Age of Wireless and The Flat Earth. A new studio album, A Map of the Floating City, followed in 2011, with guest appearances from Mark Knopfler, Regina Spektor, Imogen Heap, and others. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60718/thumb/1445625357" art="/library/metadata/60718/art/1445625357" addedAt="1438446692" updatedAt="1445625357">

  <Directory ratingKey="65562" key="/library/metadata/65562/children" type="artist" title="TiÃ«sto" titleSort="Tiesto" summary="Highly regarded by both DJ Magazine and fans of electronic dance music, TiÃ«sto launched his career as one of the world&apos;s foremost trance DJs, due in part to his legendary six-hour live sets. A native of Breda, Netherlands, TiÃ«sto was born Tijs Verwest on January 17, 1969, and first started DJ&apos;ing at a hometown club called the Sprock. Discovered there by the GM of Rotterdam-based independent label Basic Beat Recordings, TiÃ«sto released his first of five mix CDs as a part of the label&apos;s Forbidden Paradise series. With quick success and an accelerated work ethic, he partnered with Arny Bink in 1997 to form Black Hole Recordings, a private label that became the birthplace for both his Space Age and revered Magik series. Black Hole also brought the world the first mix compilations from artists like Ferry Corsten, Johan Gielen, and Armin van Buuren, and introduced yet another prized series called In Trance We Trust. &#xD;&#xA;Relentless global touring ensued and, in three short years, the world outside Holland took notice of TiÃ«sto&apos;s talent, with Nettwerk finally signing him to a stateside deal. Summerbreeze marked TiÃ«sto&apos;s U.S. debut, a mix album that showcased his remix of Delerium&apos;s &quot;Silence&quot; (featuring Sarah McLachlan), an epic 11-and-a-half-minute tour de force of throbbing beats and sweeping synthesizers with McLachlan&apos;s vocals at the forefront. Aside from reverberating throughout dance clubs everywhere, the remix was commercially successful as well, spending four weeks in the U.K. Top Ten, peaking at number three on the Billboard dance charts, and becoming one of the most influential tracks of the progressive dance era. Soon recognized as one of the most sought-after producers and remixers, TiÃ«sto helped pioneer a stylized musical trend of weaving threads of ethereal female vocals deep within the ebbs and flows of pulsating electronic rhythms. He churned out female-fueled remixes that spanned the gamut, including tracks by Chicane, Leigh Nash of Sixpence None the Richer (on Delerium&apos;s &quot;Innocente&quot;), and Faithless. &#xD;&#xA;In My Memory, TiÃ«sto&apos;s first solo album, was released in 2001, mixing original compositions and club anthems with more commercial fare. The following year found his catalog expanding with the release of the third installment of his hypnotically elegant, Ibiza-influenced, and aptly named mix compilation entitled In Search of Sunrise. Just Be followed in 2004, as did Parade of the Athletes, which served as the soundtrack to the opening ceremony of the 2004 Olympic Games and recalled the work of Jean Michel Jarre and Giorgio Moroder. By the time Elements of Life appeared in 2007, TiÃ«sto had added rock and pop music to his repertoire. Released in 2009, Kaleidoscope included a rangy guest list, running from Sigur RÃ³s vocalist JÃ³nsi to pop singer Nelly Furtado. A year later, Magikal Journey: The Hits Collection 1998-2008 rounded up some career highlights, while 2011 saw the launch of a new city-based mix series when Club Life, Vol. 1: Las Vegas hit the shelves. Club Life, Vol. 2: Miami followed a year later, featuring TiÃ«sto&apos;s remixes of Coldplay (&quot;Paradise&quot;) and Gotye (&quot;Somebody That I Used to Know&quot;), while 2013&apos;s Club Life, Vol. 3: Stockholm featured remixes of artists like Icona Pop (&quot;I Love It&quot;) and Passion Pit (&quot;Carried Away&quot;). ~ Robert Evanoff" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/65562/thumb/1445628254" art="/library/metadata/65562/art/1445628254" addedAt="1438446532" updatedAt="1445628254">

  <Directory ratingKey="61795" key="/library/metadata/61795/children" type="artist" title="Tool" summary="Tool&apos;s greatest breakthrough was to meld dark underground metal with the ambition of art rock. Although Metallica wrote their multi-sectioned, layered songs as if they were composers, they kept their musical attack ferociously at street level. Tool didn&apos;t. They embraced the artsy, bohemian preoccupations of Jane&apos;s Addiction while they simultaneously paid musical homage to the relentlessly bleak visions of grindcore, death metal, and thrash. Even with their post-punk influences, they executed their music with the aesthetic of prog rock, alternating between long, detailed instrumental interludes and lyrical rants in their songs.&#xD;&#xA;Tool had a knack for conveying the strangled, oppressive angst that the alternative nation of the early &apos;90s claimed as its own. So, Tool were able to slip into the definition of alternative rock during the post-Nirvana era, landing a slot on the third Lollapalooza tour in 1993, which helped their first full-length debut album, Undertow, rocket to platinum status. By the time the band delivered its belated follow-up, Ãnima, in 1996, alternative rock had lost its grip on the mainstream of America, and Tool&apos;s audience had shaped up as essentially metal-oriented, which meant that the group and the record didn&apos;t capture as big an audience as their first album, despite debuting at number two on the charts. After a co-headlining slot with Korn on Lollapalooza &apos;97 wrapped up, Tool remained on the road, supporting Ãnima until well into the next year. &#xD;&#xA;During the band&apos;s usual extended hiatus between albums, Maynard James Keenan decided to use his downtime productively by forming a side project, dubbed A Perfect Circle. The band&apos;s 2000 debut, Mer de Noms, was a surprise hit, while the ensuing tour was a sold-out success as well. With Tool breakup rumors swirling, the band put the speculation to rest by re-entering the recording studio and issuing the stopgap B-sides/DVD set Salival late the same year. Finally, May 2001 saw the release of Tool&apos;s third full-length release, Lateralus, which debuted at the number one position on the Billboard album chart and became the band&apos;s biggest hit. After the obligatory several-year sabbatical to pursue other projects, the group returned with another chart-topper, 10,000 Days, in 2006. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Greg Prato" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61795/thumb/1445625833" art="/library/metadata/61795/art/1445625833" addedAt="1438448457" updatedAt="1445625833">

  <Directory ratingKey="61669" key="/library/metadata/61669/children" type="artist" title="Tori Amos" summary="Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos) was one of several female singer/songwriters who combined the stark lyrical attack of alternative rock with a distinctly &apos;70s musical approach, creating music that fell between the orchestrated meditations of Kate Bush and the stripped-down poetics of Joni Mitchell. In addition, she revived the singer/songwriter traditions of the &apos;70s while re-establishing the piano as a rock &amp; roll instrument. With her 1992 album Little Earthquakes, Amos built a dedicated following that expanded with her second album, Under the Pink, before giving way to a decade-spanning legacy.&#xD;&#xA;The daughter of a Methodist preacher, Amos was born in North Carolina but raised in Maryland. She began singing and playing piano in the church choir at the age of four, and songwriting followed shortly afterward. Amos proved to be a quick learner, and her instrumental prowess earned her a scholarship to the preparatory school at Baltimore&apos;s Peabody Conservatory. While studying at Peabody, she became infatuated with rock &amp; roll, particularly the music of Led Zeppelin. She lost her scholarship at the age of 11 -- quite possibly due to her interest in popular music -- but continued writing songs nevertheless, eventually moving to Los Angeles in her late teens to become a pop singer. Atlantic Records signed her in 1987, and Amos recorded an uninspired pop-metal album called Y Kant Tori Read the following year. The record was a complete failure, attracting no attention from radio or press and selling very few copies; nevertheless, she didn&apos;t lose her record contract. By 1990, Amos had adopted a new approach, singing spare, haunting, semi-confessional piano ballads that were arranged like Kate Bush but had the melodies and lyrical approach of Joni Mitchell. Atlantic sponsored a trip to England in 1991, where she played a series of concerts in support of an EP, Me and a Gun.&#xD;&#xA;The harrowing &quot;Me and a Gun&quot; was an autobiographical song, telling the tale of Amos&apos; own experience with rape. It gained positive reviews throughout the media, and both the EP and the supporting concerts sold well. Little Earthquakes, Amos&apos; first album as a singer/songwriter, was released in 1992 and fared well in both the U.S. and the U.K. The same year, she released the Crucify EP, which featured cover songs like Nirvana&apos;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and Led Zeppelin&apos;s &quot;Thank You.&quot; Delivered in early 1994, Under the Pink, the proper follow-up to Little Earthquakes, was an even bigger hit, selling over a million copies and launching the minor hit singles &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Cornflake Girl.&quot; Two years later, Amos delivered her third album, Boys for Pele, her most ambitious and difficult record to date. The album debuted at number two and quickly went platinum. &#xD;&#xA;Amos spent much of 1997 dealing with personal matters, including a miscarriage and a marriage. She also worked on her fourth album, From the Choirgirl Hotel, which was released in the spring of 1998. The two-disc To Venus and Back followed in 1999 to coincide with a tour with Alanis Morissette. In 2001, Amos returned with the covers album Strange Little Girls, which also marked her last release for Atlantic. &#xD;&#xA;The next year, she found a new label home with Epic and followed with Scarlet&apos;s Walk in October. Her eighth studio album, an autobiographical record titled The Beekeeper, was released in 2005. The massive five-disc Piano collection arrived in 2006, boasting a cornucopia of album cuts, B-sides, unedited and alternate versions, demos, and seven previously unissued tracks, followed by the typically eclectic and hard-rocking American Doll Posse in 2007, an all-new collection of songs that found the artist assuming five archetypal personalities, all of whom were based on feminine gods in Greek and Roman mythology. &#xD;&#xA;As she toured in support of the album, Amos released live digital recordings of each concert as part of the Legs and Boots concert series, which grew to encompass 27 albums. Although each release was made available via iTunes and other online vendors, Amos also released a &quot;best-of&quot; Legs and Boots compilation in March 2009, having created its track list from various recordings during the tour. Meanwhile, she also focused on new material that had been written during the tour, which she soon compiled into her tenth studio album. Entitled Abnormally Attracted to Sin, the album was released in May 2009 by Universal Republic, Amos&apos; new record label. A holiday album, Midwinter Graces, followed closely behind, appearing before the end of 2009 and garnering warm reviews. &#xD;&#xA;In the summer of 2011, Amos began touring in advance of her next album, the classically based song cycle Night of Hunters. A conceptual work based on familiar motifs by composers Satie, Chopin, Schubert, and Bach, Amos&apos; recording centers on a couple torn apart by life&apos;s difficulties and monotonies, and the female protagonist&apos;s journey to find wholeness within herself. Amos collaborated on the recording with the string quartet Apollon Musagete, arranger John Philip Shenale, and clarinetist Ernst Ottensamer. Night of Hunters was released by the classical label Deutsche Grammophone in September of 2011; it peaked at 24 on the Billboard 200. Amos&apos; next move was to re-record some of her songs, newly arranged by John Philip Shenale, with the Metropole Orchestra. The resulting set, called Gold Dust, appeared almost exactly a year after Night of Hunters; it debuted at 63 on the Billboard 200. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61669/thumb/1445625828" art="/library/metadata/61669/art/1445625828" addedAt="1438448554" updatedAt="1445625828">

  <Directory ratingKey="60668" key="/library/metadata/60668/children" type="artist" title="Tracy Chapman" summary="Tracy Chapman helped restore singer/songwriters to the spotlight in the &apos;80s. The multi-platinum success of Chapman&apos;s eponymous 1988 debut was unexpected, and it had lasting impact. Although Chapman was working from the same confessional singer/songwriter foundation that had been popularized in the &apos;70s, her songs were fresh and powerful, driven by simple melodies and affecting lyrics. At the time of her first album, there were only a handful of artists performing such a style successfully, and her success ushered in a new era of singer/songwriters that lasted well into the &apos;90s. Furthermore, her album helped usher in the era of political correctness -- along with 10,000 Maniacs and R.E.M., Chapman&apos;s liberal politics proved enormously influential on American college campuses in the late &apos;80s. Of course, such implications meant that Chapman&apos;s subsequent recordings were greeted with mixed reactions, but after several years out of the spotlight, she managed to make a very successful comeback in 1996 with her fourth album, New Beginning, thanks to the Top Ten single &quot;Give Me One Reason.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;Raised in a working class neighborhood in Cleveland, OH, Chapman learned how to play guitar as a child, and began to write her own songs shortly afterward. Following high school, she won a minority placement scholarship and decided to attend Tufts University, where she studied anthropology and African studies. While at Tufts, she became fascinated with folk-rock and singer/songwriters, and began performing her own songs at coffeehouses. Eventually, she recorded a set of demos at the college radio station. One of her fellow students, Brian Koppelman, heard Chapman play and recommended her to his father, Charles Koppelman, who ran SBK Publishing. In 1986, she signed with SBK and Koppelman secured a management contract with Elliot Roberts, who had worked with Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. Roberts and Koppelman helped Chapman sign to Elektra in 1987.&#xD;&#xA;Chapman recorded her debut album with David Kershenbaum, and the resulting eponymous record was released in the spring of 1988. Tracy Chapman was greeted with enthusiastic reviews, and she set out on the road supporting 10,000 Maniacs. Within a few months, she played at the internationally televised concert for Nelson Mandela&apos;s 70th birthday party, where her performance was greeted with thunderous applause. Soon, the single &quot;Fast Car&quot; began climbing the charts, eventually peaking at number six. The album&apos;s sales soared along with the single, and by the end of the year, the record had gone multi-platinum. Early the following year, the record won four Grammys, including Best New Artist. &#xD;&#xA;It was an auspicious beginning to Chapman&apos;s career, and it was perhaps inevitable that her second album, 1989&apos;s darker, more political Crossroads, wasn&apos;t as successful. Although it was well-reviewed, the album wasn&apos;t as commercially successful, peaking at number nine and quickly falling down the charts. Following Crossroads, Chapman spent a few years in seclusion, returning in 1992 with Matters of the Heart. The album was greeted with mixed reviews and weak sales, and Chapman had fallen into cult status. Three years later, she returned with New Beginning, which received stronger reviews than its predecessor. The bluesy &quot;Give Me One Reason&quot; was pulled as the first single, and it slowly became a hit, sending the album into the U.S. Top Ten in early 1996. It was a quiet, successful comeback from an artist most observers had already consigned to forever languish in cult status. Telling Stories followed in early 2000. Let It Rain followed two years later. For 2005&apos;s Where You Live, Chapman co-produced the album with Tchad Blake. Our Bright Future, co-produced by Chapman and Larry Klein, appeared in 2008.   ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60668/thumb/1445625344" art="/library/metadata/60668/art/1445625344" addedAt="1438448870" updatedAt="1445625344">

The contract contained a clause which allowed him to release side projects under different names, in addition to regular Tricky releases. &quot;Ponderosa&quot; and &quot;Overcome&quot; were released over the course of 1994; that same year, he made a cameo on Massive Attack&apos;s second album, Protection. Tricky&apos;s debut album, Maxinquaye, appeared in the spring of 1995. Not only did the album receive overwhelmingly positive reviews when it was released, but it entered the U.K. charts at number two, despite the total lack of daytime radio airplay. Throughout 1995, Tricky was omnipresent in the U.K., collaborating with and remixing for a wide variety of artists, including BjÃ¶rk, Luscious Jackson, and Whale. In the fall of 1995, he released Tricky vs. the Gravediggaz, a collaboration with the American hardcore rap group, as well as a single called &quot;I Be the Prophet,&quot; which was released under the name Starving Souls. At the end of the year, Maxinquaye topped many year-end polls in Britain, including Melody Maker and NME.&#xD;&#xA;In February of 1996, Nearly God -- an album featuring Tricky&apos;s collaborations with artists as diverse as Terry Hall, BjÃ¶rk, Alison Moyet, and Neneh Cherry -- was released, again to strong reviews; the album was released in the U.S. six months later. After completing the second full-fledged Tricky album, he relocated to New York City early in 1996 where he began working with underground rappers. An EP called Grassroots was released in the U.S. in September. Two months later, Tricky&apos;s official second album, Pre-Millennium Tension, was released. Again, Tricky received positive reviews, though there were a few dissenting opinions.&#xD;&#xA;In addition to his three releases of 1996, he remixed artists as diverse as Elvis Costello, Garbage, Yoko Ono, and Bush. Tricky&apos;s next full-length solo effort, Angels with Dirty Faces, appeared in 1998, followed a year later by Juxtapose, a collaboration with Cypress Hill&apos;s DJ Muggs and DMX&apos;s Grease. In 2001, Tricky returned with the Mission Accomplished EP, which was released by the Epitaph subsidiary label Anti. Blowback, his first for Hollywood Records, appeared later that June and included various collaborations with Hawkman, Live&apos;s Ed Kowalczyk, and Red Hot Chili Peppers&apos; Anthony Kiedis and John Frusciante. Increasingly aware of his brooding persona in the media and annoyed that popular music magazines had started labeling him &quot;the Dark Prince,&quot; in 2003, he made Vulnerable as an attempt to expose himself as a more accessible artist. The same year, the Back to Mine label released an album of remixes that he compiled, before he took a five-year hiatus from recording new material. Knowle West Boy, his most critically acclaimed recording since Pre-Millennium Tension, marked a strong return by the trip-hop pioneer in 2008, and Tricky toured for a solid year behind it. In August of 2010, he emerged with the single &quot;Murder Weapon&quot; a reworking of Echo Minott&apos;s &apos;90s-era dancehall hit that obsessed him. Following in the tradition of his infamous read of Public Enemy&apos;s &quot;Black Steel&quot; with backing vocalist Martina Topley-Bird, &quot;Murder Weapon,&quot; like its precursor, also featured a female voice, in this case, Irish-Italian singer Franky Riley, one of his backing vocalists on the road. Tricky followed the single with the album Mixed Race later that fall. Unhappy with Domino Records, he started his own False Idols label for the release of his tenth solo album, also named False Idols. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61586/thumb/1445625780" art="/library/metadata/61586/art/1445625780" addedAt="1438448598" updatedAt="1445625780">

The Twang were formed in 2004 in Birmingham by singer Phil Etheridge and bassist Jon Watkin under the name Neon Twang. Inspired by guitar bands such as Oasis and the Streets as well as &quot;Madchester&quot; acts like Happy Mondays, Neon Twang were created as a reaction to the dance music that was sweeping the U.K. at the time, and the band developed a reputation for melodic but straightforward guitar-based rock and an unpretentious approach. (As Etheridge told a reporter, &quot;I ain&apos;t going to sing about rivers, man. I don&apos;t live by a river. I live by a canal and there&apos;s bikes in it.&quot;) Neon Twang also became known as a band not afraid to get rowdy, and as violence among fans became increasingly common at gigs, the band shortened its name to the Twang to help shake off the negative side of its reputation. Adding a second vocalist, Martin Saunders, as well as Stu Hartland on guitar and Matty Clinton on drums, the Twang became a potent live act, and in the fall of 2006 the band came to the attention of the U.K. music press in a big way when James Jam, a writer for New Musical Express, and Edith Bowman, a DJ at Radio One, caught a Twang show in Birmingham. Both left mightily impressed, and Jam gave the band a major write-up while Bowman began playing the group&apos;s demos on the air. By the end of 2006, a bidding war had broken out over the Twang, with B-Unique Recordings (home of the Kaiser Chiefs and Primal Scream) signing the band to a deal. The Twang&apos;s first single, Wide Awake, was released in mid-March 2007, with a second single, Either Way, following a few weeks later. Both records reached the British Top 20, and the group&apos;s first album, Love It When I Feel Like This, arrived in early June.  In early 2008, the band enlisted former Killing Joke member, Youth to help them record their second studio album, Jewellery Quarter. Named after the area in Birmingham where they now resided, the record entered the UK Top 20 in 2009. The first single to be released from it was Barney Rubble. In 2010, the group announced the departure of guitarist Stu Hartland and the arrival of replacement, Jimmy Jazz - although Hartland continued to play live for the band. It was during this time that they began recording and writing with long-term friend and producer Jon âSimmoâ Simcox. In 2011, they announced the details of the EP Guapa. Limited to 1,000 copies, it sold out almost immediately. Towards the end of 2012, they released their third album, 10:20 and announced that original drummer Matty Clinton was sacked (due to theft of the bandâs equipment) and that Ash Sheehan was to be his replacement. The album - which was funded by the band and recorded in their own studio - was their most daring to date and featured a cover of Durutti Columnâs Tomorrow. ~ Mark Deming" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/62076/thumb/1445625958" art="/library/metadata/62076/art/1445625958" addedAt="1438448410" updatedAt="1445625958">

  <Directory ratingKey="60653" key="/library/metadata/60653/children" type="artist" title="Ultras Sound" summary="Exalted by their own operatic prog-glam ambitions, Ultrasound appeared in the late &apos;90s as a violent reworking of the idiosyncratic compositions of Captain Beefheart and the staged ambisexual pop idioms of the likes of Gary Glitter and David Bowie. Andrew &quot;Tiny&quot; Wood (voice, guitar), Richard Green (bass), Pete Haslem (keyboards), and Andy Peace (drums) had splintered away from Newcastle&apos;s Sleepy People in February of 1994 in hopes to break the pulsing London circuit, starting off with the inauspicious moniker of Pop-A-Cat-A-Petal. After a self-titled debut EP on Org Records, the band replaced Haslem with Matt Jones and drafted in Vanessa Best for bass, forcing Green to take up lead guitar and giving the band enough reason to brand themselves the more commercial-friendly name, Ultrasound.&#xD;&#xA;In many ways, Green&apos;s switch of instruments represented an important turnaround. As a new lead guitarist, he steered the band away from the more esoteric chaos of their Newcastle roots, heard in ribald detail on the band&apos;s first single under the Ultrasound banner, 1997&apos;s &quot;Same Band&quot; for Fierce Panda, and kept the band refueled during a series of NME-sponsored events for unsigned bands, thereby putting the group in the position to land a deal with Nude Records following a bidding war. The Sony-financed label meant more coverage in the British music press, and by the time Ultrasound issued the aggressive &quot;Best Wishes&quot; and &quot;Stay Young&quot; singles in 1998, many already earmarked the band&apos;s early affinity with the pleasures of fandom and its manic enthusiast trappings. With consistently positive reviews in their pocket and an ever-growing fan base behind them, Ultrasound went off to play a triumphant set at 1998&apos;s Glastonbury Festival and were later singled out as another big, bright hope for British music.&#xD;&#xA;However, the long delay before their debut album surfaced; the sprawling double-disc, triple-LP Everything Picture, had transformed new friends into enemies. By the spring of 1999, negative reviews for the album began to flow, criticizing its overreach, and audiences dwindled, feeling that their patience was abused. For a band that excelled on big gestures, Ultrasound went into a period of self-constructed collapse. A series of live dates were scuppered, including their crucial T in the Park appearance, and each cancellation was followed by claims of a band busy at work on a sophomore LP and the impossibility of a group on the verge of a split. Nonetheless, on October 12, 1999, the band issued a statement that Ultrasound were no more.&#xD;&#xA;Amidst the ruins of the band, several follow-up projects emerged. Richard Green started the Somatics; Matt Jones went off to form Minuteman; Vanessa Best recorded a number of solo demos; and Wood tried to reform a new Ultrasound along with Andy Peace, old friend Andy Taylor, ex-Sleepy People bassist Bill &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bailey, and keyboardist Carlie. Ultrasound mach II made their re-debut at the Newcastle Arts Centre in the spring of 2000, even popped into a studio from time to time, but this would be the last anybody heard from them. By the summer of 2001, Wood appeared unattached from his new Ultrasound incarnation and returned full circle to lend his talents to the recording of Blue Apple Boy&apos;s debut LP, a product of a band previously, and not too surprisingly, known as Sleepy People. ~ Dean Carlson" index="1" addedAt="1438448868" updatedAt="1445625325">

  <Directory ratingKey="61489" key="/library/metadata/61489/children" type="artist" title="Underworld" summary="Underworld became one of the most crucial electronic acts of the 1990s via an intriguing synthesis of old and new. The trio&apos;s two-man frontline, vocalist Karl Hyde and guitarist Rick Smith, had been recording together since the early-&apos;80s new wave explosion; after two unsuccessful albums released as Underworld during the late &apos;80s, the pair finally hit it big after recruiting Darren Emerson, a young DJ hipped to the sound of techno and trance. Traditional pop song forms were jettisoned in favor of Hyde&apos;s heavily treated vocals, barely there whispering, and surreal wordplay, stretched out over the urban breakbeat trance ripped out by Emerson and company while Smith&apos;s cascade of guitar-shard effects provided a bluesy foil to the stark music. All in all, the decision to go pop was hardly a concession to the mainstream. The first Underworld album by the trio, Dubnobasswithmyheadman, appeared in late 1993 to a flurry of critical acclaim; the trio then gained U.S. distribution for the album with TVT. Second Toughest in the Infants, the group&apos;s sophomore LP, updated its sound slightly and received more praise than the debut. Unlike the first, the LP also sold well, thanks in part to the non-album single &quot;Born Slippy,&quot; featured on the soundtrack to the seminal film Trainspotting.&#xD;&#xA;The roots of Underworld go back to the dawn of the 1980s, when Hyde and Smith formed a new wave band called Freur. The group released Doot-Doot in 1983 and Get Us Out of Here two years later, but subsequently disintegrated. Hyde worked on guitar sessions for Debbie Harry and Prince, then reunited with Smith in 1988 to form an industrial-funk band called Underworld. The pair earned an American contract with Sire and released its debut album, Underneath the Radar, in 1988. Change the Weather followed one year later, even though little attention had been paid to the first. By the end of the decade, Underworld had disappeared as well.&#xD;&#xA;As they had several years earlier, Hyde and Smith shed their skin yet again, recruiting hotshot DJ Darren Emerson and renaming themselves Lemon Interrupt. In 1992, the trio debuted with two singles, &quot;Dirty&quot;/&quot;Minneapolis&quot; and &quot;Bigmouth&quot;/&quot;Eclipse,&quot; both released on Junior Boys Own Records. After they reverted back to Underworld, 1993&apos;s &quot;Rez&quot; and &quot;MMM...Skyscraper I Love You&quot; caused a minor sensation in the dance community. Instead of adding small elements of techno to a basically pop or rock formula (as many bands had attempted with varying success), Underworld treated techno as the dominant force. Their debut album, Dubnobasswithmyheadman, was praised by many critics upon release later in 1993 and crossed over to the British pop charts. Hyde, Smith, and Emerson impressed many at their concert dates as well; the trio apparently relished playing live, touring Great Britain twice plus Japan, Europe, and the annual summer festival circuit, where their Glastonbury appearance became the stuff of legend.&#xD;&#xA;Dubnobasswithmyheadman was released in the U.S. in 1995 after being licensed to TVT Records. During the rest of the year, Underworld were relatively quiet, releasing only the single &quot;Born Slippy.&quot; Finally, Second Toughest in the Infants appeared in early 1996 to much critical praise. The trio gained no small amount of commercial success later in the year when &quot;Born Slippy&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to Trainspotting, the controversial Scottish film that earned praise from critics all over the globe. Underworld also remained busy with Tomato -- their own graphic design company responsible for commercials from such high-profile clients as Nike, Sony, Adidas, and Pepsi -- and remixing work for Depeche Mode, BjÃ¶rk, St. Etienne, Sven VÃ¤th, Simply Red, and Leftfield. Emerson continued to DJ on a regular basis, releasing mix albums for Mixmag! and Deconstruction. Though Underworld&apos;s 1999 LP, Beaucoup Fish, was initially a critical and commercial disappointment, the band continued to tour the world. The live album Everything, Everything followed in 2000, after which Emerson left to continue his DJ career. A Hundred Days Off, Underworld&apos;s first LP as a duo since 1989, was released in mid-2002. One year later, the stopgap compilation 1992-2002 appeared.&#xD;&#xA;By 2005, the duo had officially been joined by one of Britain&apos;s most respected DJs, Darren Price (although he contributed to A Hundred Days Off), and his work also appeared on a series of online-only EPs Underworld released during 2005 and 2006. They also recorded new material for the soundtrack of the Anthony Minghella film Breaking and Entering. Their first &quot;proper&quot; full-length since 2002, Oblivion with Bells, appeared in 2007. It was followed in 2010 by Barking, an album that featured numerous guest producers including Paul van Dyk, Appleblim, and High Contrast. ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61489/thumb/1445625740" art="/library/metadata/61489/art/1445625740" addedAt="1438448644" updatedAt="1445625740">

  <Directory ratingKey="61475" key="/library/metadata/61475/children" type="artist" title="UNKLE" summary="Experimental hip-hop outfit UNKLE were one of the original artists releasing material through noted U.K. label Mo&apos; Wax, which helped launch the instrumental mid-&apos;90s downtempo breakbeat revival eventually termed trip-hop. Though hardly the label&apos;s highest-profile group (at least until the long-delayed release of their debut LP in 1998), UNKLE&apos;s members included label head James Lavelle, who formed Mo&apos; Wax while still in his teens as an antidote to the increasingly stale acid jazz/Northern soul scene. Stripping the music down to its barest of essentials -- bass, percussion, minimal samples, and heavy effects -- the Mo&apos; Wax sound (best exemplified by the second Mo&apos; Wax label comp, Headz, as well as its sequel, the two-part Headz II) quickly gained respectability and a large audience. Although not as prolific as other Mo&apos; Wax artists such as DJs Shadow and Krush, UNKLE nonetheless played a crucial role in cementing Mo&apos; Wax&apos;s early sound though their Time Has Come double EP, the latter of which featured remixes of the title track by Plaid, Portishead, and U2 producer Howie B.&#xD;&#xA;The UNKLE trio was comprised of Lavelle, Tim Goldsworthy (a mate of Lavelle&apos;s since childhood), and producer Kudo, of seminal Japanese label Major Force (and a member of the on-again, off-again psychedelic beat crew Skylab). Previous to his entry into production, Lavelle, along with Goldsworthy, was deep into New York hip-hop and electro, the emerging late-&apos;80s Sheffield bleep scene, the English acid jazz scene (which he covered as a columnist for Straight No Chaser magazine), and of course the acid house and techno explosions that were redefining the English counterculture at the time. The pair hooked up with third member Kudo through the growing rep of the latter&apos;s Love T.K.O. project, whose outbound interpretations of breakbeat and acid jazz drew Lavelle&apos;s ear. While Goldsworthy and Kudo remained more heavily involved in nuts &apos;n&apos; bolts production (especially given the success of Mo&apos; Wax, with the penning of an expansive partial ownership deal with A&amp;M Records in 1996), Lavelle was heavily involved in the conceptual and organizational end, crafting beats and laying out vague sketches his partners then expanded into full-blown tracks. &#xD;&#xA;Despite the scarcity of released material, UNKLE grew to wider acclaim during 1996 through remix projects for Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and Tortoise. After Goldsworthy and Kudo were effectively replaced by Mo&apos; Wax bill-payer DJ Shadow, the all-star LP Psyence Fiction finally appeared in 1998. It was a disappointment considering the advance hype, and DJ Shadow distanced himself from the collective. Lavelle, amid much work as a DJ, recruited singer/songwriter Richard File for the second UNKLE full-length, 2003&apos;s Never, Never, Land. Four years later, Lavelle and File returned with War Stories, including both collaborators from the past (Josh Homme) and new associates (Ian Astbury, Chris Goss) to contribute to the heaviest-sounding UNKLE release to date. A pair of odds &apos;n&apos; ends collections, More Stories and End Titles...Stories for Film (both released in 2008), featured old and new material, including music from UNKLE&apos;s soundtrack to the documentary Odyssey in Rome. In 2009 the âHeavy Drugâ single announced the coming of their 2010 album Where Did the Night Fall. ~ Sean Cooper &amp; John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61475/thumb/1445625731" art="/library/metadata/61475/art/1445625731" addedAt="1438448675" updatedAt="1445625731">

  <Directory ratingKey="60747" key="/library/metadata/60747/children" type="artist" title="The Verve" titleSort="Verve" summary="Long acclaimed as one of the most innovative and spellbinding bands on the contemporary British pop scene, the Verve finally broke through to a mass international audience in 1997 with the instant classic &quot;Bittersweet Symphony.&quot; By no stretch a study in overnight success, the group&apos;s rise was instead the culmination of a long, arduous journey that began at the dawn of the decade and went on to encompass a major breakup, multiple lawsuits, and an extensive diet of narcotics. Perfecting an oceanic sound that fused the exploratory vision of &apos;60s-era psychedelia with the shimmering atmospherics of the shoegazer aesthetic, the Verve languished in relative obscurity while waiting for the rest of the music world to play catch-up, creating one of the most complex and rewarding bodies of work in modern rock &amp; roll long before most listeners even learned of the group&apos;s existence -- only to again fall apart at the peak of their success. &#xD;&#xA;Originally known simply as Verve, the group was formed in the small Northern English city of Wigan in 1989. Richard Ashcroft -- a swaggering, shamanic figure in the classic rock star mold -- led the band, whose original lineup also included guitarist Nick McCabe, bassist Simon Jones, and drummer Peter Salisbury. Sharing a collective fondness for the Beatles, Funkadelic, and Krautrock -- as well as a legendary appetite for psychedelics -- the quartet signed to the Hut label within months, debuting in March 1992 with the single &quot;All in the Mind,&quot; the first in a series of indie chart-topping efforts featuring the eye-catching artwork of designer Brian Cannon. Subsequent efforts like &quot;She&apos;s a Superstar&quot; and &quot;Gravity Grave&quot; captured an original musical identity growing by leaps and bounds, distinguished chiefly by Ashcroft&apos;s elemental vocals and McCabe&apos;s echoing guitar leads.&#xD;&#xA;While Verve&apos;s long, liquid jams found favor on the British indie charts, pop radio looked the other way. Their majestic debut LP, 1993&apos;s A Storm in Heaven, was a critical smash, but positive reviews from a variety of critics failed to translate into strong record sales. The following summer, Verve appeared on the second stage at Lollapalooza, a tour tempered by a string of disasters -- not only was Salisbury arrested for destroying a Kansas hotel room, but Ashcroft was also hospitalized after suffering from severe dehydration. Around that same time, the American jazz label also dubbed Verve slapped the band with a lawsuit, forcing the quartet to officially change its name to &quot;the Verve.&quot; Sessions for the 1995 follow-up, A Northern Soul, proved to be the last straw -- admittedly recorded under the influence of a massive intake of Ecstasy, the album&apos;s harrowing intensity was met with disappointing sales and little media recognition, and just three months after its release, Ashcroft made his exit.&#xD;&#xA;Although Ashcroft quickly reassembled the Verve a few weeks later, McCabe initially refused to return, and was replaced by guitarist/keyboardist Simon Tong. Finally, in early 1997, McCabe came back to the fold, and as a quintet they recorded Urban Hymns, their breakthrough LP. Heralded by the smash &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; -- a single built around a looped sample of a symphonic recording of the Rolling Stones&apos; &quot;The Last Time&quot; -- Urban Hymns launched the Verve among the U.K.&apos;s most popular bands. Even at their peak, however, the curse of the band&apos;s past lingered on, as legal hassles awarded 100 percent of the song&apos;s publishing rights to ABKCO Music, which controlled the Stones&apos; back catalog. The second single from the album, the haunting &quot;The Drugs Don&apos;t Work,&quot; became the Verve&apos;s first U.K. number one smash, while the hit singles &quot;Lucky Man&quot; and &quot;Sonnet&quot; soon followed. However, when McCabe pulled out of the group&apos;s 1998 U.S. tour, the group suffered yet another blow. After months of rumors, the Verve officially split the following spring.&#xD;&#xA;Ashcroft launched a solo career in the early 2000s and enjoyed success with a number of singles, including &quot;Break the Night With Colour.&quot; Meanwhile, Nick McCabe remixed a track for the Music and collaborated with British songwriter John Martyn, while Tong and Jones formed a short-lived band named the Shining. Tong later joined the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen in July 2006, and although he continued to focus on his post-Verve projects, the remaining members of the Verve reunited in 2007 for an international tour. The band also set to work on another studio album, Forth, which was released in August 2008 following a successful year of sold-out concerts and festival dates. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60747/thumb/1445625369" art="/library/metadata/60747/art/1445625369" addedAt="1438455291" updatedAt="1445625369">

  <Directory ratingKey="61382" key="/library/metadata/61382/children" type="artist" title="Wilco" summary="Wilco rose from the ashes of the seminal roots rock band Uncle Tupelo, which disbanded in 1994. While Jay Farrar, one of the group&apos;s two singer/songwriters, went on to form Son Volt, his ex-partner Jeff Tweedy established Wilco along with the remaining members of Tupelo&apos;s final incarnation, which included drummer Ken Coomer as well as part-time bandmates John Stirratt (bass) and Max Johnston (mandolin, banjo, fiddle, and lap steel). Guitarist Jay Bennett rounded out the group, which in 1995 issued its debut album, A.M., a collection of spry country-rock tunes that followed the course established in Tweedy&apos;s earlier work. &#xD;&#xA;Wilco&apos;s sophomore effort, 1996&apos;s two-disc set Being There, marked a radical transformation in the group&apos;s sound; while remaining steeped in the style that earned Tweedy his reputation, the songs took unexpected detours into psychedelia, power pop, and soul, complete with orchestral touches and R&amp;B horn flourishes. Shortly after the release of Being There, which most critics judged to be among the year&apos;s best releases, Johnston left the group to play with his sister, singer Michelle Shocked, and was replaced by guitarist Bob Egan of the band Freakwater. At the same time, while remaining full-time members of Wilco, Stirratt, Bennett, and Coomer also began performing together in the pop side project Courtesy Move. In 1998, Wilco collaborated with singer/songwriter Billy Bragg on Mermaid Avenue, a collection of performances based on unreleased material originally written by Woody Guthrie. &#xD;&#xA;Their stunningly lush third album, Summerteeth, followed in 1999 and met with critical acclaim but only average sales, initiating tensions with their label, Warner Bros. Mermaid Avenue, Vol. 2, which featured more selections from the band&apos;s collaborations with Bragg on Woody Guthrie&apos;s unfinished songs, was issued in 2000. Following this release, longtime drummer Ken Coomer decided to amicably leave the band and was replaced by the Chicago-based Glenn Kotche. Wilco then focused on recording their fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, which ultimately led to the departure of guitarist Jay Bennett and further tensions with their label. Unwilling to change the album to make it more &quot;commercially viable,&quot; Wilco bought the finished studio tapes from Warner/Reprise for a reported $50,000 and left the label altogether. &#xD;&#xA;Leaked tracks from the album surfaced on the Internet in late 2001, and the stripped-down lineup of Tweedy, Kotche, Stirratt, and multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach embarked on a small tour to support -- or drum up support for -- the unreleased record. Nonesuch Records picked up the album and officially released it in early 2002 to widespread critical acclaim. Meanwhile, an independent film documenting the drama surrounding the album (I Am Trying to Break Your Heart) followed in the fall of 2002. During the down time after the album was recorded, Tweedy composed and recorded the film score to the Ethan Hawke film Chelsea Walls, which ended up being released around the same time as Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. &#xD;&#xA;Wilco toured extensively following the release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and in 2003 began work on their next album, A Ghost Is Born. While sessions went smoothly compared to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, after the album was finished Leroy Bach left the band in a split that was described as mutual and amicable; guitarist Nels Cline, keyboardist Mike Jorgensen, and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone joined Wilco for their subsequent tour. Shortly before the album&apos;s release, Tweedy surprised many fans by announcing he had entered a drug rehabilitation facility to treat a dependency on painkillers, prescribed to treat a long history of migraine headaches aggravated by panic disorder. Tweedy discussed his health problems in depth, along with the often tangled history of Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, in Wilco: Learning How to Die, a biography of the group written by rock journalist Greg Kot, published to coincide with A Ghost Is Born&apos;s release in the spring of 2004. &#xD;&#xA;The following year, the group released Kicking Television: Live in Chicago, a 23-track collection recorded in the Windy City&apos;s Vic Theater, an album that was later deemed one of the Top 20 best live albums by Q Magazine. In 2007 Wilco&apos;s sixth studio album, Sky Blue Sky, hit shelves. Less experimental than its predecessors, Sky Blue Sky peaked at number five on the U.S. album charts and made a strong showing internationally. Wilco&apos;s seventh album, the breezy and laid-back Wilco (The Album), was released on June 30, 2009, one month after the death of former bandmember Jay Bennett, who passed away in his home in Urbana, Illinois after accidentally overdosing on the prescription painkiller fentanyl. At the end of touring that album, the band took a break for much of 2010 (their longest break since formation) and resurfaced in 2011 with their own label, dBpm Records, and the release of The Whole Love. ~ Jason Ankeny &amp; Zac Johnson" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61382/thumb/1445625662" art="/library/metadata/61382/art/1445625662" addedAt="1438448956" updatedAt="1445625662">

  <Directory ratingKey="61349" key="/library/metadata/61349/children" type="artist" title="William Orbit" summary="Ambient pioneer, studio master, and omnipresent dance remixer William Orbit began his musical career in the new wave band Torch Song. Even while the group recorded several albums for IRS, Orbit remained in the studio to learn the ropes and began producing and remixing for artists including Sting, Madonna, Prince, the Human League, Erasure, and Belinda Carlisle. Orbit concurrently recorded his own material, and released his first solo album, Orbit, in 1987. That same year, he inaugurated the ambient project Strange Cargo, which released follow-up albums in 1990 and 1993. Also during the late &apos;80s, Orbit latched onto the acid house explosion in England and founded one of the scene&apos;s most notable labels, Guerilla Records. Orbit&apos;s own Bassomatic recorded for Guerilla alongside British progressive acts Spooky and React 2 Rhythm plus excellent Chicago producers Felix da Housecat and DJ Pierre. Through Virgin, Bassomatic also released an album, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Bass.&#xD;&#xA;Though his release schedule slowed slightly during the &apos;90s, William Orbit continued producing and remixing at a furious pace. He also founded a new label, N-Gram Recordings, and prepared to release the classical crossover work Pieces in a Modern Style. The album, which featured electronic interpretations of classical pieces, drew angry protests from composers Arvo PÃ¤rt and Henryk GÃ³recki, and they helped block the album&apos;s release. In 1998, after 15 years of behind the scenes post-production, Orbit&apos;s name hit the mainstream thanks to his helming the Madonna comeback album Ray of Light (Orbit not only produced the entire LP, but co-wrote many of the tracks). The album won Grammy awards for Best Pop Album and Best Dance Recording, and its success led to a host of remixing and production work, including Blur&apos;s 1999 album, 13. In 2000, Orbit finally released Pieces in a Modern Style, and the album became an unexpected hit thanks to Ferry Corsten&apos;s trance remix of Samuel Barber&apos;s Adagio for Strings. In 2006 he returned with Hello Waveforms on the Sanctuary label. Finley Quaye appeared on the album along with former Torch Song/Strange Cargo vocalist Laurie Mayer. My Oracle Lives Uptown followed in 2009 on the Kobalt label, and one year later he released Pieces in a Modern Style 2, another edition of classical material, including Orbit&apos;s version of &quot;Swan Lake.&quot; ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/61349/thumb/1445625637" art="/library/metadata/61349/art/1445625637" addedAt="1438448981" updatedAt="1445625637">

  <Directory ratingKey="60734" key="/library/metadata/60734/children" type="artist" title="The xx" titleSort="xx" summary="Atmospheric English indie pop group the xx formed in London in 2008 around the talents of Romy Madley Croft, Oliver Sim, Baria Qureshi, and Jamie Smith, when the bandmembers were still in high school. Captivating and cool, the group cites influences that run the gamut from R&amp;B (Aaliyah and Rihanna) to classic alternative rock (the Cure and the Pixies). Built around the duel vocals of Croft and Sim, the group&apos;s signature brand of moody, soulful indie rock first appeared on the public radar in early 2009 with the single &quot;Crystalised,&quot; which created a huge buzz among critics and fans alike. The xx released their self-titled debut LP in July of that year in the U.K.; it was released in the U.S. the following month. Late that year, Qureshi was no longer part of the group; the rest of the xx released a statement via NME saying this was due to &quot;personal differences.&quot; During 2010, the live dates only continued, including spots at several high-profile summer festivals, and in September, their album won Britain&apos;s coveted Mercury Prize. Meanwhile, Smith worked with Gil Scott-Heron on the remix album We&apos;re New Here (in turn spawning the Drake song &quot;Take Care,&quot; which sampled the pair&apos;s &quot;I&apos;ll Take Care of U&quot;). In mid-2012, a pair of singles, &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Chained,&quot; heralded the release of the group&apos;s second album Coexist that September. ~ James Christopher Monger" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/60734/thumb/1445625371" art="/library/metadata/60734/art/1445625371" addedAt="1438454263" updatedAt="1445625371">

  <Directory ratingKey="58230" key="/library/metadata/58230/children" type="artist" title="Zoe" summary="b. Zoe Pollock, Peckham, London, England. Zoe made a huge impact in 1991 with the release of her debut single, âSunshine On A Rainy Dayâ, a perfect Europop cover version that went to number 4 in the UK charts. It had originally been released a year earlier when it reached the Top 60. However, subsequent efforts âLightningâ and âHoly Daysâ fared poorly. When her solo debut also flopped, she found herself in conflict with her label bosses over the extensive personal appearances she was required to perform at tawdry discos throughout Europe, and the relationship almost collapsed. Pollock had joined her first band, the soul outfit Cacique, after leaving stage school aged 16. She eventually regrouped in 1995 and began working on new tracks with her partner Youth, whom she first met while auditioning for Brilliant at his Butterfly Studios in Brixton. When she presented these to her record company M&amp;G Records, new A&amp;R director Jack Steven was impressed, and arranged for a concurrent US release of the album by RCA Records. Most of the instruments on Hammer  were played by Youth, though the duoâs emotional relationship had sundered during the sessions - leaving Youth doubtlessly wondering at whom some of the more pointed lyrics were aimed. Rather than the slightly sickly pop of her debut, Hammer comprised a number of bittersweet lyrics and harsh vignettes, typified by âLove Is The Beastâ and the title track. Zoeâs interest in the ethnic music of Ireland and India was also well represented in the Buddhist mantra âR.A.Mâ and âDown The Mountainâ. âThe Lion Roarsâ, meanwhile, was written in tandem with Anthony Thistlewaite, formerly of the Waterboys, and co-produced by revered Irish producer Donal Lunny in Dublin with Davy Spillane contributing uillean pipes." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/58230/thumb/1445624481" addedAt="1438449476" updatedAt="1445624481">

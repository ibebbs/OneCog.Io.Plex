Unfortunately, it&apos;s the former, rather than the latter, which dominates the follow-up to his grime-inspired introductory No.5 Collaborations Project EP. Indeed, the unexpected hugely popular response to lead single &quot;The A Team,&quot; an achingly tender tale of a heroin-addicted prostitute (think a socially aware James Blunt) seems to have thrown him off course, as rather than pursue the more urban direction that set him apart from his contemporaries, the majority of Plus&apos; 12 tracks feel like self-conscious attempts to replicate its sound. The sparse piano chords and stream-of-consciousness delivery (&quot;I knew you loved Shrek cos we&apos;ve watched it twelve times&quot;) of &quot;Wake Me Up,&quot; the gentle percussion and lilting piano hooks of &quot;Small Bump,&quot; and the melancholic wistful folk of &quot;This&quot; are all melodic, Damien Rice-esque numbers that would no doubt go down like a storm on one of the many open-mike nights Sheeran used to frequent. But for an artist who has built up a reputation for his inventive fusion of sounds, they are disappointingly back-to-basics affairs which offer little that hasn&apos;t been heard before. However, Sheeran is a much more interesting prospect when his unassuming manner is accompanied by an array of skittering hip-hop beats and staccato R&amp;B licks. &quot;You Don&apos;t Need Me, I Don&apos;t Need You&quot; is a blistering swipe at the music industry which shows that while he may not have the conventional image of a rapper, he certainly possesses the quick-witted attitude; &quot;U.N.I.&quot; combines Snow Patrol-esque guitar hooks with a breakneck-speed delivery reminiscent of Craig David&apos;s early 2000s output; while some dirty, scuzzy guitars and electronic bleeps are thrown into the mix on &quot;The City,&quot; which deals with his experience of moving from his hometown of to the bright lights of London. With his casual jeans and hoodie, and relatable tales of relationship woes, university, and getting drunk, it&apos;s easy to see why Sheeran has struck such a chord with the late-teens/early-twenties crowd. But his debut&apos;s failure to capitalize on his unique selling point means it&apos;s likely to leave everyone else nonplussed. ~ Jon O&apos;Brien" index="1" year="2011" thumb="/library/metadata/63672/thumb/1445627103" art="/library/metadata/63671/art/1445626621" parentThumb="/library/metadata/63671/thumb/1445626621" originallyAvailableAt="2011-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438448193" updatedAt="1445627103">

On this date, Coil were John Balance on vocals, Peter Christopherson on sequencers, Thighpaulsandra on keyboards, and Tom Edwards on marimba. This combination of musicians appeared on Live Two, recorded two years earlier. Where that set was abrasive and loud, this one is largely subdued, very different from the other recordings of Coil that appeared over the course of the Live series. Balance takes the mic to explain the subdued nature of the material, &quot;We&apos;re doing a quiet set today. We&apos;ve had too much shouting over the past year.&quot; Of the five lengthy tracks, four are completely new and one is a radical reworking of &quot;The Dreamer Is Still Asleep&quot; from Musick to Play in the Dark. Most of the set appears to be improvised, especially the glossaholalic &quot;Snow Falls on Military Temples&apos;&quot; and &quot;Triple Sons and the Ones You Bury,&quot; where Balance appears to be channeling his lyrics from another plane, suggesting phrases and then settling in on one which gets repeated and morphed into something totally new. Most of the song titles on this album are generated from those very phrases. Of all the live Coil albums that have been released, and there are a lot of them, ...And the Ambulance is one of the more satisfying. It is an excellent document of Coil&apos;s improvisatory nature, a side that was not displayed on their studio albums much, if at all. ~ James Mason" index="1" year="2005" thumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" art="/library/metadata/61395/art/1445625678" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" originallyAvailableAt="2005-01-01" leafCount="5" addedAt="1438445235" updatedAt="1445628878">

While there is still deft fingerstyle guitar to spare, more of King&apos;s picking is set inside of a greater context -- percussion and light orchestration provide new universes for her to explore, and she revels in the experimental possibilities. Much of Until We Felt Red retains the lighter-than-air feel of the first two albums, Everybody Loves You and Legs to Make Us Longer, but King takes greater care here to fill the spaces with often unanticipated sounds and textures. Both electric guitars and electronics in general, and King&apos;s whispery sweet vocal -- itself used more for coloring than to make important lyrical statements -- also take a front-row seat here. But this is neither a singer/songwriter album nor an attempt to use technology for its own sake. Everything King brings to Until We Felt Red, produced by John McEntire, is in service of the composition, and if that means verging on improvisational jazz, or washing a melody in the quasi-baroque, as she does on &quot;You Don&apos;t Have to Be Afraid,&quot; then so be it. The set-closing &quot;Gay Sons of Lesbian Mothers,&quot; with its thumped bass and slide guitar, veers toward funk with a touch of Nashville tossed in. But those seeking the imaginative, intricate acoustic playing that characterized King&apos;s earlier work need not, well, fret. Every track -- notably &quot;Ahuvati,&quot; &quot;First Brain,&quot; &quot;Second Brain,&quot; and the title track -- is rich with gleaming guitaristry. What&apos;s different is that King, whose first notices came when she entertained New York subway riders, can no longer be described simply as a guitarist. From here on, she&apos;ll be watched as a complete artist. ~ Jeff Tamarkin" index="1" year="2006" thumb="/library/metadata/65025/thumb/1445628630" art="/library/metadata/65024/art/1445627725" parentThumb="/library/metadata/65024/thumb/1445627725" originallyAvailableAt="2006-01-01" leafCount="13" addedAt="1438447057" updatedAt="1445628630">

Thankfully, Tool has somehow managed to circumvent these rituals, releasing a record every four to five years as they so feel the need. This ability to patiently craft their musical direction has paid off for not only the band, but for listeners, as they&apos;ve been able to expand their musical vocabulary from album to album with great precision, all the while remaining true to the foundations that built such a loyal, if not cult-like, following. But with this absence comes changes to the popular music landscape, as new bands and sounds (as well as a new generation of heavy metal fans to entertain) replace and stimulate the charts. Namely: a lot can happen in five years, especially with a fickle rock audience that is overinundated with constant new bands&apos; songs. The group defied expectations (and even got radio airplay) with Lateralus, but would fans stick with them during the hiatus? There were moments when Maynard James Keenan would emerge courtesy of A Perfect Circle, and there were also several stunning video DVDs to pacify while 10,000 Days was being written, along with cryptic messages via their website, but that was about it.&#xD;&#xA;Thankfully, 10,000 Days was worth the labor pains and wait to deliver. It&apos;s not only a step forward for the band, but a re-embracing of the epic-length rock songs found at the roots of early heavy metal. The album starts out with &quot;Vicarious,&quot; which features some of Maynard&apos;s most straightforward lyrics since Ænema&apos;s &quot;Hooker with a Penis.&quot; Essentially a biting commentary on reality television, information stimulus overload, and living through others&apos; experiences, it&apos;s only a brief glimpse of what&apos;s to come, as 10,000 Days also offers some of Keenan&apos;s most confessional lyrics. The 17-minute epic &quot;Wings for Marie/10,000 Days&quot; is an ode to his mother, who passed away during the band&apos;s hiatus after dealing with paralysis from a stroke for 27 years. In a way, it&apos;s voyeuristic to listen to someone working out family issues on disc, but Keenan does it in a way that&apos;s sensitive and honest without ever treading the careful line between melodrama and sincerity. Most of the songs are a bit long in the tooth when compared to most metal songs these days, but then again, Tool isn&apos;t exactly just another band, either. With most songs clocking in over six minutes, the exercises in songwriting wouldn&apos;t work as well with any other band. But when you have such high-caliber musicianship as Danny Carey and Adam Jones anchoring drums and guitar, respectively, it&apos;s hard to make a wrong turn. The anger that served as fuel for some of their greatest works has been replaced with calmer and more introspective moments as they patiently work out rhythm and melodic passages from one theme to the next. That&apos;s not to say the anger isn&apos;t still there; it does check in from song to song, but like most of Tool&apos;s fan base that has stuck with them through their first recordings, the group has evolved beyond that stage and has moved on to new concepts to explore. So depending upon which Tool you are looking for, you&apos;re either going to love or hate 10,000 Days. If it&apos;s the hard-driving band with an intellectually driven existential anger and fits of Hot Topic-laden angst, they&apos;ve fled for other pastures (probably to Arizona Bay). But if you&apos;re looking for the Tool whose passion and introspection is complemented by intense emotion, brutal honesty, and musical maturity, you&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find a better metal album in 2006. ~ Rob Theakston" index="1" year="2006" thumb="/library/metadata/61844/thumb/1445625841" art="/library/metadata/61795/art/1445625833" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61795/thumb/1445625833" originallyAvailableAt="2006-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438448457" updatedAt="1445625841">

In a way, he already succeeded with his previous album, Play, a remarkable record that cannily used field recordings and blues as the basis for an expert set of modern electronica -- through repeated exposure (every song was licensed for a commercial or a movie) and sheer hard work, it became a massive hit, unlike most albums in its genre, establishing Moby as one of the few electronica superstars. It also gave him the freedom to make a record as meditative and assured as 18, a quietly seductive set that capitalizes on his status as a star in the sense that he takes complete freedom to make music that isn&apos;t necessarily hip. Essentially, this is a lateral move away from Play, abandoning its attention-grabbing musical thesis of turning the past into the present -- there are still hints of roots music, yet they&apos;re usually telegraphed through soulful vocals that have always been a staple of house and dance music -- and returning to his bedrock of dance and electronic music, yet presented with the skill he illustrated on Play, a new open-heartedness and, yes, a maturity previously unheard in his music. Maturity is often seen as a death-knell criticism, especially in a perpetually fashion-conscious genre like electronica, but this is only a good thing here, because it means that Moby not only creates a shimmering, reflective mood from the outset, but that he sustains it throughout the 18 songs, as the album shifts from pop and soul songs to soaring instrumental stretches, letting the sound deepen and change colors with each new track. Cynics could snipe and say this is coffeehouse, yuppie electronica or claim that he&apos;s done nothing new with this record, and they&apos;d be right only in the coldest, literal sense that it would appeal to upscale urban listeners and that he&apos;s not really breaking new ground, only consolidating his strengths. Yet that is no small thing -- he has created a record that might not be as wildly eclectic on the surface as Play, and it certainly lacks club hits on the level of &quot;Bodyrock&quot; or &quot;South Side,&quot; but it&apos;s a warm, enveloping, humanistic record with real emotional resonance, which surely is a noteworthy artistic step forward.

The double-album 1962-1966, commonly called The Red Album, does the job surprisingly well, hitting most of the group&apos;s major early hits and adding important album tracks like &quot;You&apos;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away,&quot; &quot;Drive My Car,&quot; &quot;Norwegian Wood,&quot; and &quot;In My Life.&quot; Naturally, there are many great songs missing from the 26-track 1962-1966, and perhaps it would have made more sense to include the Revolver cuts on its companion volume, 1967-1970, yet The Red Album captures the essence of the Beatles&apos; pre-Sgt.

It suggested that 2001 wouldn&apos;t simply be recycled Chronic, and, musically speaking, that&apos;s more or less true. He&apos;s pushed himself hard, finding new variations in the formula by adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae, resulting in fairly interesting recontextualizations. Padded out to 22 tracks, 2001 isn&apos;t as consistent or striking as Slim Shady, but the music is always brimming with character. If only the same could be said about the rappers! Why does a producer as original as Dre work with such pedestrian rappers? Perhaps it&apos;s to ensure his control over the project, or to mask his own shortcomings as an MC, but the album suffers considerably as a result. Out of all the other rappers on 2001, only Snoop and Eminem -- Dre&apos;s two great protégés -- have character and while Eminem&apos;s jokiness still is unpredictable, Snoop sounds nearly as tired as the second-rate rappers. The only difference is, there&apos;s pleasure in hearing Snoop&apos;s style, while the rest sound staid. That&apos;s the major problem with 2001: lyrically and thematically, it&apos;s nothing but gangsta clichés. Scratch that, it&apos;s über-gangsta, blown up so large that it feels like a parody. Song after song, there&apos;s a never-ending litany of violence, drugs, pussy, bitches, dope, guns, and gangsters. After a full decade of this, it takes real effort to get outraged at this stuff, so chances are, you&apos;ll shut out the words and groove along since, sonically, this first-rate, straight-up gangsta. Still, no matter how much fun you may have, it&apos;s hard not to shake the feeling that this is cheap, not lasting, fun.

The album earned her a ton of fans, and interest was high for the inevitable follow-up. In many ways, her sophomore album, the similarly age-appropriate-titled 21, is a continuation of the sounds and themes Adele was working with on 19. She is still the bluesy pop diva with a singer/songwriter&apos;s soul and seemingly bottomless capacity for heartbreak. The best thing the album does is to showcase Adele&apos;s titanic vocal ability, which -- more than a few times on 21 -- is simply spine-tingling. Last time around we got the gauzy, Callier-esque folk-soul ballad &quot;Daydreamer&quot; to slowly draw us into the album; here, Adele immediately injects us with the propulsive gospel fever-blues anthem &quot;Rolling in the Deep.&quot; While the track certainly owes a heavy debt to the punk-blues of Beth Ditto and the Gossip, it is also ridiculously sexy and one of the best singles of any decade. Elsewhere, we get tracks like the blues-inflected Ryan Tedder co-write &quot;Rumour Has It&quot; and the old-school-style soul cut &quot;He Won&apos;t Go,&quot; which are terrifically catchy, booty-shaking numbers and exactly the kind of songs you want and expect from Adele. Similarly enthralling is the centerpiece of the album, the mega-ballad showstopper &quot;Take It All.&quot; Co-written by her &quot;Chasing Pavements&quot; partner Francis White, the song begins with Adele proclaiming &quot;Didn&apos;t I give it all?&quot; Delivered starkly at first with Adele set against simple piano accompaniment and later backed by a gospel choir, it&apos;s an instant-classic sort of song in the tradition of &quot;The Rose,&quot; &quot;And I Am Telling You I Am Not Going,&quot; and &quot;All by Myself&quot; that could stand over the years as a career landmark for the singer and a cathartic moment for fans who identify with their idol&apos;s Pyrrhic lovelorn persona.

It was so big it turned Green Day into something it had never been before -- respected, serious rockers, something they were never considered during their first flight of success with Dookie. Back then, they were clearly (and proudly) slacker rebels with a natural gift for a pop hook, but American Idiot was a big album with big ideas, a political rock opera in an era devoid of both protest rock and wild ambition, so its success was a surprise. It also ratcheted up high expectations for its successor, and Green Day consciously plays toward those expectations on 2009&apos;s 21st Century Breakdown, another political rock opera that isn&apos;t an explicit sequel but could easily be mistaken for one, especially as its narrative follows a young couple through the wilderness of modern urban America. Heady stuff, but like the best rock operas, the concept doesn&apos;t get in the way of the music, which is a bit of an accomplishment because 21st Century Breakdown leaves behind the punchy &apos;60s Who fascination for Queen and &apos;70s Who, giving this more than its share of pomp and circumstance. Then again, puffed-up protest is kind of the point of 21st Century Breakdown: it&apos;s meant to be taken seriously, so it&apos;s not entirely surprising that Green Day fall into many of the same pompous tarpits as their heroes, ratcheting up the stately pianos, vocal harmonies, repeated musical motifs, doubled and tripled guitars, and synthesized effects that substitute for strings, then adding some orchestras for good measure. It would all sound cluttered, even turgid, if it weren&apos;t for Green Day&apos;s unerring knack for writing muscular pop and natural inclination to run clean and lean, letting only one song run over five minutes and never letting the arrangements overshadow the song. Although Green Day&apos;s other natural gift, that for impish irreverent humor, is missed -- they left it all behind on their 2008 garage rock side project Foxboro Hot Tubs -- the band manages to have 21st Century Breakdown work on a grand scale without losing either their punk or pop roots, which makes the album not only a sequel to American Idiot, but its equal. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/60185/thumb/1445625308" art="/library/metadata/60165/art/1445625107" parentThumb="/library/metadata/60165/thumb/1445625107" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="18" addedAt="1438452781" updatedAt="1445625308">

Cole&apos;s captivating charm made her the perfect pop star, and her better-than-most&apos;s voice never slowed her down. In the last quarter of the 2000s, she found her own success away from her multi-platinum roots by becoming the fourth judge on the monstrously successful U.K. television program The X-Factor. Cole&apos;s role as a judge and mentor to contestants made her even more of a celebrity than she already was -- quite a feat -- and helped Cole gain the courage to release her first solo studio album since she entered the music business. Her talents were, and still are, geared towards mainstream pop, however, unlike the contestants she mentors on the X-Factor, Cole is not a budding star; she&apos;s a dignified celebrity starting a new chapter in her music career; and though she was 26 years old upon the release of her first solo effort, 3 Words, she has the maturity of a true music veteran. All to say, her first album couldn&apos;t rely on gimmicks or empty beats like many early debuts; it also couldn&apos;t have the no-care pop attitude that her early Girls Aloud albums did, or their contemporary counterparts, the Saturdays. Therefore, she teamed up with an established hitmaker, will.i.am, famous for his work with the Black Eyed Peas, and with him Cole has strung together a solid collection of sparkily pop hits that seem to be stuck in between vibrance and polish; in other words, they don&apos;t feel too old and stuffy, but they are a bit stale in large part. Cole does have some smash singles here; lead single &quot;Fight for This Love&quot; is a terrific midtempo number with a heck of a chorus, and its follow-up, &quot;Parachute,&quot; shines for its undeniable catchiness and lethal drum line. Still, the rest of the album, especially the four songs that feature will.i.am -- too much for any one person to be featured on one album, unless you are Justin Timberlake and Timbaland -- seem uninspiring, especially for a superstar like Cole, who has all of the globe waiting for her to deliver a monster smash. Numbers like &quot;Stand Up&quot; seem to briefly tease the listener with Cole&apos;s potential to rule the European dance charts on her own, but this muddy first effort doesn&apos;t suggest that that moment is right now. Cole should work harder on her next album to find a more dynamic sound, which may be difficult since she is past her Girls Aloud sound, but she&apos;s also not the kind of artist who would soar on a collection of ballads like X-Factor&apos;s Leona Lewis or Cole&apos;s own famous X-Factor prodigy, Alexandra Burke . ~ Matthew Chisling" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/63822/thumb/1445627426" art="/library/metadata/63821/art/1445626857" parentThumb="/library/metadata/63821/thumb/1445626857" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="10" addedAt="1438452693" updatedAt="1445627426">

Pepper, but featuring stronger compositions and more rock-oriented ensemble work. The group was still pushing forward in all facets of its art, whether devising some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record (especially on &quot;Because&quot;), constructing a medley of songs/vignettes that covered much of side two, adding subtle touches of Moog synthesizer, or crafting furious guitar-heavy rock (&quot;The End,&quot; &quot;I Want You (She&apos;s So Heavy),&quot; &quot;Come Together&quot;). George Harrison also blossomed into a major songwriter, contributing the buoyant &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and the supremely melodic ballad &quot;Something,&quot; the latter of which became the first Harrison-penned Beatles hit. Whether Abbey Road is the Beatles&apos; best work is debatable, but it&apos;s certainly the most immaculately produced (with the possible exception of Sgt. Pepper) and most tightly constructed.

It&apos;s clearly by far the most conventional of the duo&apos;s albums, the closest to a straight-up hard techno set they ever did. Tracks like the opening &quot;Expander&quot; are almost anonymous; &quot;Pulse State&quot; honestly sounds like it could be by any one of a dozen contemporaneous techno acts. Two tracks, however, lift Accelerator above anonymity: the whirring, chattering pulse of &quot;It&apos;s Not My Problem&quot; sounds like Can on E, and the sublime &quot;Papua New Guinea,&quot; based on a guest vocal by Dead Can Dance&apos;s Lisa Gerrard, was (for 1991) something entirely new: ethno-ambient. This idea was subsequently run into the ground by far too many less-talented hacks, but even after being subjected to those knockoffs, &quot;Papua New Guinea&quot; still sounds majestic and fascinating.

It is no surprise, then, that lead singer Nigel Clark left the group in mid-1998 when the popularity of Brit-pop had officially hit an all-time low. With the release of Ace A&apos;s and Killer B&apos;s, a 18 track greatest hits and B-sides retrospective, the band effectively closed the book on their first incarnation and also opened the doors for the future. The disc collects nearly all of Dodgy&apos;s finest moments from their first three albums and 19 singles onto a single disc featuring one new single &quot;Every Single Day.&quot; It seems pointless to be so nostalgic over a band that was so short-lived and released so little material, but what is contained on Ace A&apos;s and Killer B&apos;s is nothing less than first-rate Brit-pop. From the sloppy, electrified &quot;In a Room&quot; to the tribal beats on &quot;The Elephant,&quot; there&apos;s enough here to please any fan or non-fan. The inclusion of several B-sides and the one new track makes it essential for collectors as well. The only true flaws are that a few singles are substituted by lackluster album material (&quot;Grassman,&quot; &quot;Ain&apos;t No Longer Asking&quot;) and that Dodgy will never make music like this again. [Some copies of this album were issued with a second disc featuring remixes of many of Dodgy&apos;s biggest hits and album tracks. While the disc is competent electronica, it hardly represents the sound of the band as a whole. Dodgy were essentially trad-rock revivalists, so their songs don&apos;t work well in the remixed format. Also, the tracks are so heavily remixed that almost none resemble their original versions, especially since the remix disc is largely instrumental.

By this time, the band recruited in a new keyboardist by the name of Kjartan Sveinsson, and it seems to have done nothing but take the band to an even higher state of self-awareness. Even in aesthetic matters, Sigur Rós title their sophomore effort not in a manner to play up the irony of high expectations (à la the Stone Roses&apos; Second Coming), but in a modest realization. This second album -- Ágætis Byrjun -- translates roughly to &quot;Good Start.&quot; So as exemplary as Von might have been, this time out is probably even more worthy of dramatic debut expectations. Indeed, Ágætis Byrjun pulls no punches from the start. After an introduction just this side of one of the aforementioned Stone Roses&apos; backward beauties, the album pumps in the morning mist with &quot;Sven-G-Englar&quot; -- a song of such accomplished gorgeousness that one wonders how such a tiny country as Iceland can musically outperform entire continents in just a few short minutes. The rest of this full-length follows such similar quality. Extremely deep strings underpin falsetto wails from the mournfully epic (&quot;Viðar Vel Tl Loftárasa&quot;) to the unreservedly cinematic (&quot;Avalon&quot;). One will constantly be waiting to hear what fascinating turns such complex musicianship will take at a moment&apos;s notice. At its best, the album seems to accomplish everything lagging post-shoegazers like Spiritualized or Chapterhouse once promised. However, at its worst, the album sometimes slides into an almost overkill of sonic structures. Take &quot;Hjartað Hamast (Bamm Bamm Bamm),&quot; for instance: there are so many layers of heavy strings, dense atmospherics, and fading vocals that it becomes an ineffectual mess of styles over style. As expected, though, the band&apos;s keen sense of Sturm und Drang is mostly contained within an elegant scope of melodies for the remainder of this follow-up. Rarely has a sophomore effort sounded this thick and surprising. Which means that &quot;Good Start&quot; might well become one of the most charming understatements to come from a band in years. ~ Dean Carlson" index="1" year="1999" thumb="/library/metadata/64078/thumb/1445627663" art="/library/metadata/64077/art/1445627071" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64077/thumb/1445627071" originallyAvailableAt="1999-01-01" leafCount="10" addedAt="1438448023" updatedAt="1445627663">

On Youth &amp; Young Manhood, the Kings gave Southern rock a swift kick in the rear, sounding like Lynyrd Skynyrd posing as a bunch of N.Y.U. film students (or vice versa). For their latest, the Nashville quartet raises a flag that&apos;s equal parts Confederate and Union Jack. Their success in the U.K. is understandable, as Caleb Followill&apos;s lazy drawl sounds like a cross between Bon Scott, Ray Davies, and Eddie Money with a slight Jamaican accent, but it&apos;s their seamless and agreeable blend of rock &amp; roll, country, and Roky Erickson-style psychedelia, matched with a keen lyrical wit, that makes them fascinating to both sides of the pond. On the twenty-something barfly opener &quot;Slow Night, So Long,&quot; Caleb laments/celebrates the soulless dance of the one-night stand (&quot;She&apos;s opened up just like she really knows me/I hate her face, but enjoy the company&quot;) like a true student of outlaw country. It&apos;s a theme that runs rampant throughout Heartbreak, and whether it&apos;s set against a swamp-sick boogie (&quot;Pistol of Fire&quot;) or emitted through a lonesome yodel (&quot;Day Old Blues&quot;), it resonates as clear and cool as the opening notes of a Creedence Clearwater Revival tune.

Led by the sonorous Peter Liddle, whose choirboy voice harbors a surprising amount of power, Alarms in the Heart feels sonically similar to its predecessor, but it possesses a sturdier backbone, despite existing in a near constant state of musical melodrama. This is evident from the outset, as the impossibly lush title track which, like much of the album, sounds a little like Fleet Foxes taking on Love&apos;s &quot;Along Again Or,&quot; sets the tone and locks it in, serving as an excellent litmus test. The shadow of Brandon Flowers looms large over the rousing &quot;Hidden Hand,&quot; the gorgeous &quot;Roman Candle&quot; is tailor-made for a stone circle, West Country slow dance, the nervy &quot;Everlasting Light&quot; houses shades of British Sea Power-inspired post-rock, and the propulsive &quot;Med School&quot; and &quot;Rollerskate&quot; prove that Dry the River aren&apos;t actually the most serious band in the world (that trophy belongs to the like-minded Shearwater). By the time the listener reaches &quot;Hope Diamond,&quot; the 11-minute closer, which is actually two different songs (one is hidden mid-&apos;90s style), they&apos;re suitably exhausted, though not unpleasantly so. Dry the River&apos;s best asset is the conviction with which they sell each moment, and the aptly named album, for all of its cacophonous posturing, always feels like it&apos;s coming directly from the heart, even as it&apos;s set to explode.

Endlessly compared to Mogwai -- who can make aggressively angry music when they want to -- this quartet consciously seeks what is meandering and beautiful. If there is a strategy behind their music as revealed by 2001&apos;s Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever and 2003&apos;s The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place, it&apos;s that beauty seeks tension to resolve itself and find itself even in seeming chaos. This music featuring layered guitars, piano, bass, and drums begins with melody and more often than not ends with it, no matter how far from the quiet and even halting lyricism the band wandered into at the beginning. Which raises two questions. First, is All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone different from the other pair of records on Temporary Residence? And, of course, since one must confront the seemingly eternal academically trained analysis and cynicism of the indie world, &quot;Is it necessary?&quot; The answer to both questions is &quot;yes.&quot; While the surface of Explosions in the Sky&apos;s sonic sense of labyrinthine adventure is similar, the manner in which they get to the center of each piece is not. On &quot;The Birth and Death of the Day,&quot; which opens the set, violence and noise are threatened from the beginning with distorted chords, feedback, and big crescendos. Space enters before lyricism here, though harmonically everything resonates as one, and for a moment one thinks that this is a forgotten intro to some lost and found U2 song of yore, but they quickly pass that mark and dig inside the chaos for its roots and branches. &quot;It&apos;s Natural to Be Afraid&quot; begins with subtle dissonance and the guitars emerging out of quiet chaos with sounds and pianos playing slowly and contrapuntally. It takes over 13 minutes to wind up, down, and around again, but it&apos;s an exercise that is rewarding for a patient listener -- or if you simply want to close your eyes and go with it. &quot;So Long, Lonesome,&quot; at under four minutes, closes the set. Its piano lines take a front seat as guitars provide counterpoint and a sonic backdrop, and the tension force field never rises above a four. It&apos;s almost a chamber piece. Ultimately, there is real growth here, subtle and unpretentious as it is. All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone is another gorgeous exercise by Explosions in the Sky.

Their debut album, All Years Leaving, is coated in honey-sweet vocal harmonies, rollicking tempos, gently strummed guitars, and a general sense of easy nostalgia. Many, many bands have treaded this leaf-strewn, autumnal path and the Stands don&apos;t do much to distance themselves from the pack, nor do they stumble significantly. Middle of the packers then and that&apos;s not so bad. In fact, it is unfailingly pleasant. The tunes tend to blend together in a sepia-toned wave of gentle melancholia, but there are worse ways to spend 40 minutes. There are even a few that you will want to throw on mixtapes, like the dreamy opener, &quot;I&apos;ve Waited So Long&quot;; &quot;The Love You Give,&quot; which has a languid beat, slow-motion guitar plucking, and fine la-la-la backing vocals; and the album&apos;s crown jewel, &quot;Here She Comes Again.&quot; It&apos;s definitely a cousin to the La&apos;s&apos; &quot;There She Goes,&quot; with a lovingly similar melody (and an almost direct lift from the Cars&apos; &quot;My Best Friend&apos;s Girl&quot;), but it adds some Byrds-y 12-string and an emotion-packed bridge that does what a bridge should and jumps the song&apos;s intensity up a notch. It&apos;s the kind of song that you will want to listen to about five times in a row every time you hear it, the kind of song that would make you want this album even if the rest stunk. If they can come up with a couple more like it on their next record, they might take a giant step to the front of the pack.

Sampling arch-metal heroes Tool and the frat rock staple &quot;Surfin&apos; Bird&quot; (not even the original &quot;Surfin&apos; Bird&quot;) for a pair of aggro-thrash tracks doesn&apos;t exactly bode well for The Altogether, and even when the duo works in more familiar territory, it&apos;s far too familiar. &quot;Funny Break (One Is Enough)&quot; is a return to the majestic, trademarked Orbital sound of their debut, &quot;Chime,&quot; but this isn&apos;t even the first time they&apos;ve gone back to their staple. &quot;Oi!&quot; is another solid production, but incredibly it also borrows heavily from their repertoire, with the hazy female siren-calls from past Orbital classics like &quot;Halcyon + On + On&quot; and &quot;The Girl With the Sun in Her Hair.&quot; And the Hartnolls&apos; one concession to the currents of electronica circa 2001, a vocalist collaboration (&quot;Illuminate&quot; featuring David Gray), is a totally misguided crossover and one of the blandest tracks they&apos;ve ever been associated with. Their cover of the Dr. Who theme may sound a little risqué to fans of the ancient sci-fi series (especially those most middle-aged and curmudgeonly), but the track is obvious and unintentionally hilarious. It&apos;s genuinely surprising to find a consistent act like Orbital slipping to such depths, but The Altogether is a poor album and by far a low point in Orbital&apos;s career. ~ John Bush" index="1" year="2001" thumb="/library/metadata/64480/thumb/1445628210" art="/library/metadata/64457/art/1445627390" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64457/thumb/1445627390" originallyAvailableAt="2001-01-01" leafCount="22" addedAt="1438447560" updatedAt="1445628210">

American Idiot is an unapologetic, unabashed rock opera, a form that Pete Townshend pioneered with Tommy, but Green Day doesn&apos;t use that for a blueprint as much as they use the Who&apos;s mini-opera &quot;A Quick One, While He&apos;s Away,&quot; whose whirlwind succession of 90-second songs isn&apos;t only emulated on two song suites here, but provides the template for the larger 13-song cycle. But the Who are only one of many inspirations on this audacious, immensely entertaining album. The story of St. Jimmy has an arc similar to Hüsker Dü&apos;s landmark punk-opera Zen Arcade, while the music has grandiose flourishes straight out of both Queen and Rocky Horror Picture Show (the &apos;50s pastiche &quot;Rock and Roll Girlfriend&quot; is punk rock Meat Loaf), all tied together with a nervy urgency and a political passion reminiscent of the Clash, or all the anti-Reagan American hardcore bands of the &apos;80s. These are just the clearest touchstones for American Idiot, but reducing the album to its influences gives the inaccurate impression that this is no more than a patchwork quilt of familiar sounds, when it&apos;s an idiosyncratic, visionary work in its own right. First of all, part of Green Day&apos;s appeal is how they have personalized the sounds of the past, making time-honored guitar rock traditions seem fresh, even vital. With their first albums, they styled themselves after first-generation punk they were too young to hear firsthand, and as their career progressed, the group not only synthesized these influences into something distinctive, but chief songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong turned into a muscular, versatile songwriter in his own right. &#xD;&#xA;Warning illustrated their growing musical acumen quite impressively, but here, the music isn&apos;t only tougher, it&apos;s fluid and, better still, it fuels the anger, disillusionment, heartbreak, frustration, and scathing wit at the core of American Idiot. And one of the truly startling things about American Idiot is how the increased musicality of the band is matched by Armstrong&apos;s incisive, cutting lyrics, which effectively convey the paranoia and fear of living in American in days after 9/11, but also veer into moving, intimate small-scale character sketches. There&apos;s a lot to absorb here, and cynics might dismiss it after one listen as a bit of a mess when it&apos;s really a rich, multi-faceted work, one that is bracing upon the first spin and grows in stature and becomes more addictive with each repeated play. Like all great concept albums, American Idiot works on several different levels. It can be taken as a collection of great songs -- songs that are as visceral or as poignant as Green Day at their best, songs that resonate outside of the larger canvas of the story, as the fiery anti-Dubya title anthem proves -- but these songs have a different, more lasting impact when taken as a whole. While its breakneck, freewheeling musicality has many inspirations, there really aren&apos;t many records like American Idiot (bizarrely enough, the Fiery Furnaces&apos; Blueberry Boat is one of the closest, at least on a sonic level, largely because both groups draw deeply from the kaleidoscopic &quot;A Quick One&quot;). In its musical muscle and sweeping, politically charged narrative, it&apos;s something of a masterpiece, and one of the few -- if not the only -- records of 2004 to convey what it feels like to live in the strange, bewildering America of the early 2000s.

It&apos;s a touch surprising -- unlike, say, fellow 1993 breakthroughs the Cranberries, David Roback and Hope Sandoval didn&apos;t rapidly descend into self-parody crossed with delusions of grandeur. Instead, they kept on keeping on, proffering the same combination of psych, blues, folk, and art-pop touches that made their earlier releases so captivating. That said, though, at base Among My Swan just isn&apos;t as quietly involving as the earlier records, that magical fusion of styles somehow coming across as a little been-there, done-that here. There&apos;s nothing quite as immediate as &quot;Fade Into You,&quot; nothing as awesomely delicate as &quot;Five String Serenade,&quot; as woozy and powerful as &quot;Mary of Silence.&quot; There are plenty of songs that try for that, though, and even if Among My Swan won&apos;t raise the dead or heal the sick, it&apos;s still pleasant enough listening, and sometimes the secret of success is in the details. Keep an ear out for the soft chimes that punctuate &quot;Happy,&quot; for instance, or how William Reid from the Jesus and Mary Chain&apos;s guest guitar helps turn &quot;Take Everything&quot; into the slow-burning monster it is. Sandoval&apos;s singing is as drowsily intoxicating as before, while Roback&apos;s ability to create atmospheres is equally fine. Among the better moments: &quot;Rhymes of an Hour,&quot; which carefully balances a quieter arrangement with sudden moments that almost but don&apos;t quite lead to a full-band jam; the acoustic-based mood-out &quot;All Your Sisters,&quot; suggesting such earlier guitar/violin efforts as &quot;Into Dust&quot;; and the soft-landing conclusion, &quot;Look on Down from the Bridge,&quot; a bit of a church hymn in its own way, thanks to the organ-led melody. ~ Ned Raggett" index="1" year="1996" thumb="/library/metadata/64698/thumb/1445628257" art="/library/metadata/64674/art/1445627425" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64674/thumb/1445627425" originallyAvailableAt="1996-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438447396" updatedAt="1445628257">

Incidentally, Coil&apos;s Peter Christopherson worked as a leading sound designer in the film and created its incidental music -- much of which is included here to fill out the CD.

An assured and durable follow-up to 2001&apos;s formative One Touch, which still packed a number of singles that gave the group a great deal of success overseas, Angels With Dirty Faces is a thoroughly convincing amalgamation of the artists they&apos;ve been weaned on -- from Madonna to TLC to Aaliyah -- with a strong foothold in contemporary trends. A bootleg mash-up of Adina Howard&apos;s &quot;Freak Like Me&quot; and Gary Numan&apos;s &quot;Are Friends Electric&quot; led to the group&apos;s own spin on the trick, and it landed them the top spot on the U.K. chart. Using a beefed-up arrangement of Numan&apos;s robotic new-wave tune, the Sugababes lift Howard&apos;s forthright lyrics -- somewhat sheepishly, the &quot;pump pump&quot; that precedes &quot;all through the night&quot; is subsumed in the mix -- and weave the two elements together for a powerful and immensely catchy opening to the album. At no point during the remainder of the first half does the album lose steam. The verses of &quot;Blue&quot; are backed by jutting electronic beats that stutter and twist, while the chorus unwraps a tempo shift carrying an unexpectedly strummy quality. &quot;Round Round,&quot; another hit that put the group on Top of the Pops, is something Garbage would no doubt love to have in their own catalog. Apart from a couple bum moments during the second half of the album -- see &quot;Shape,&quot; a misguided re-configuration of Sting&apos;s &quot;Shape of My Heart,&quot; replete with a literally patched-on appearance from the man himself -- this is a pop album that offers much more depth and excitement beyond the singles. ~ Andy Kellman" index="1" year="2002" thumb="/library/metadata/58842/thumb/1445624674" art="/library/metadata/58735/art/1445624660" parentThumb="/library/metadata/58735/thumb/1445624660" originallyAvailableAt="2002-01-01" leafCount="14" addedAt="1438448192" updatedAt="1445624674">

This covers the late &apos;50s to the end of 1964, mixing studio outtakes, live performances, primitive recordings from the Quarrymen/Silver Beatles days, excerpts from the famous 1962 Decca audition, the most notable 1961 Tony Sheridan-era recordings, and brief spoken bits from interviews. Although this material is undeniably of vast historical importance, it can&apos;t be placed in the same company as the Beatles&apos; proper albums, in either cohesion or quality. While the studio outtakes (many never even heard on bootleg) are the most enticing items, these are almost exclusively alternate versions of songs they placed on their official releases (the most notable exceptions being the 1964 R&amp;B cover &quot;Leave My Kitten Alone,&quot; the 1962 demo &quot;How Do You Do It,&quot; and the unimpressive 1964 Harrison original &quot;You Know What to Do&quot;). Sometimes the differences are quite interesting (a much more electric-oriented version of &quot;And I Love Her,&quot; for example), but the alternates also illustrate how the group were virtually unerring in selecting the best arrangement and take of their songs for the final versions. The pre-1962 items are sometimes taken from private rehearsal tapes of primitive fidelity and are really of archival value only. One could go on at great length about the many curiosities and finds unearthed by this compilation, but for most general consumers, two observations may suffice. It does not stand up to the Beatles&apos; fully conceived albums (even Live at the BBC), but the Beatles&apos; scraps and leavings are more interesting than over 95 percent of other performers&apos; best work.

But the emphasis is upon alternate takes from early 1965 to early 1968, during which time the group rapidly evolved from post-Merseybeat through folk-rock to psychedelia. As with the first volume, this is nearly always interesting but perhaps thinner on revelations than some might expect. The Help!-era outtakes &quot;If You&apos;ve Got Troubles&quot; and &quot;That Means a Lot&quot; are on the light side but very fun, especially the latter, which Paul and the group perform much better than P.J. Proby (who covered the song shortly afterward). Some of the alternate takes are extremely different and excellent performances on their own merits: the funkier version of &quot;I&apos;m Looking Through You&quot; and the less mellow arrangement of &quot;Norwegian Wood,&quot; a wall-of-drugs reverb for &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows,&quot; a very Byrds-like approach to &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; (with giggle-laden vocals), and an acoustic demo of &quot;Fool on the Hill.&quot; The earlier, much more acoustic version of &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; is the most notable gem. On the other hand, much of the material differs from the official cuts in fairly minute gradations and will be of greater interest to scholars than general listeners (although discoveries like a different solo on &quot;Penny Lane&quot; are fascinating).

In terms of sheer listenability, this may be the strongest volume of the three, if only because it focuses almost solely upon studio recordings rather than mixing live concerts/broadcasts and outtakes. Also, by this time the Beatles had perfected their approach to recording, meaning that even the early/alternate versions of many of their cuts were often of outstanding quality. There&apos;s some prime stuff here: &quot;unplugged&quot; White Album demos from mid-1968, radically different versions of &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; a stringless &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; three beautifully sung and played Harrison solo demos from early 1969, and several songs the Beatles never released, like &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; &quot;Not Guilty,&quot; &quot;Teddy Boy,&quot; &quot;Come and Get It,&quot; and &quot;Junk.&quot; Not everything here is so great that the casual consumer will be fascinated, of course.

As the last album recorded during John Balance&apos;s lifetime, it serves as a final statement and summation of the band&apos;s multi-faceted career. Naples is much more of a &quot;classic&quot;-sounding Coil album (in the vein of Love&apos;s Secret Domain and Musick to Play in the Dark, Vol. 1) than more recent outings (such as ANS, Constant Shallowness Leads to Evil, or Astral Disaster). Ape is made up of recording sessions that date back to the mid-&apos;90s, recordings done for Trent Reznor&apos;s nothing label, and more recent works that were still getting worked out in a live environment (&quot;Triple Sun,&quot; &quot;Tattooed Man&quot;). Balance and Peter Christopherson are joined by the likes of Danny Hyde, Thighpaulsandra, Ossian Brown, Cliff Stapleton, and Mike Yorke, depending on the track. Which would lead one to the assumption that the album would sound disjointed, with a rotating cast of characters involved. The magic of Coil is that the album flows as smoothly as it does, not as if it were pieced together over the years and with different collaborators. The focus of the album seems to be (perhaps consciously, perhaps not) on Balance&apos;s beautiful and expressive voice. All tracks feature his vocals, notably the industro-goth of &quot;Heaven&apos;s Blade,&quot; the twisted circus atmospheres of &quot;Tattooed Man,&quot; and quite possibly the saddest song Coil ever recorded, a cover of BBC favorite Are You Being Served&apos;s theme song, &quot;Going Up.&quot; This last is a highlight in the Coil catalog, with Balance duetting with Francois Testroy, telling the listener that &quot;it just is.&quot; The painful acceptance of this line encapsulates the experience of the album -- Balance is gone, we must move on and continue. The Ape of Naples is one of Coil&apos;s best albums and one of the best albums of 2005. ~ James Mason" index="1" year="2005" thumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" art="/library/metadata/61395/art/1445625678" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" originallyAvailableAt="2005-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438446145" updatedAt="1445628676">

At its core, the album is a collection of folk songs about aging, death, and loss, but the music has a grand, epic sweep provided by layers of lush strings, interweaving acoustic instruments, and shimmering keyboards. Automatic for the People captures the group at a crossroads, as they moved from cult heroes to elder statesmen, and the album is a graceful transition into their new status. It is a reflective album, with frank discussions on mortality, but it is not a despairing record -- &quot;Nightswimming,&quot; &quot;Everybody Hurts,&quot; and &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; have a comforting melancholy, while &quot;Find the River&quot; provides a positive sense of closure. R.E.M. have never been as emotionally direct as they are on Automatic for the People, nor have they ever created music quite as rich and timeless, and while the record is not an easy listen, it is the most rewarding record in their oeuvre. [Automatic for the People was reissued as part of Warner&apos;s 2005 R.E.M. reissue series. Each album was presented in a double-disc digipack, containing a CD on the first disc and a DVD-A version of the album on the second. The DVD for Automatic includes a 5.1 Surround mix of the album, a &quot;video documentary,&quot; lyrics, and a photo gallery, but none of the promo videos from the album.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1992" thumb="/library/metadata/61025/thumb/1445625920" art="/library/metadata/61024/art/1445625520" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61024/thumb/1445625520" originallyAvailableAt="1992-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438453142" updatedAt="1445625920">

Still, Barking doesn&apos;t spend much time there, instead visiting much brighter territory on the single &quot;Scribble,&quot; with a production by High Contrast that should have creative directors rearranging their budgets to license. The biggest name here is Paul Van Dyk, whose &quot;Diamond Jigsaw&quot; is as straight-ahead as techno can get -- and also sounds like it could earn its share of advertising dollars. Although this is hardly Underworld at their finest, the duo&apos;s songwriting fits the mainstream productions and results in a solid dance album for the 2010s -- music for aging-raver activities like driving cars, pushing swings, or jogging on treadmills. ~ John Bush" index="1" year="2010" thumb="/library/metadata/61513/thumb/1445626201" art="/library/metadata/61489/art/1445625740" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61489/thumb/1445625740" originallyAvailableAt="2010-01-01" leafCount="9" addedAt="1438448644" updatedAt="1445626201">

Only five months before, the group released the joyous A Hard Day&apos;s Night. Now, they sound beaten, worn, and, in Lennon&apos;s case, bitter and self-loathing. His opening trilogy (&quot;No Reply,&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a Loser,&quot; &quot;Baby&apos;s in Black&quot;) is the darkest sequence on any Beatles record, setting the tone for the album. Moments of joy pop up now and again, mainly in the forms of covers and the dynamic &quot;Eight Days a Week,&quot; but the very presence of six covers after the triumphant all-original A Hard Day&apos;s Night feels like an admission of defeat or at least a regression. (It doesn&apos;t help that Lennon&apos;s cover of his beloved obscurity &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; winds up as arguably the worst thing the group ever recorded.) Beneath those surface suspicions, however, there are some important changes on Beatles for Sale, most notably Lennon&apos;s discovery of Bob Dylan and folk-rock. The opening three songs, along with &quot;I Don&apos;t Want to Spoil the Party,&quot; are implicitly confessional and all quite bleak, which is a new development. This spirit winds up overshadowing McCartney&apos;s cheery &quot;I&apos;ll Follow the Sun&quot; or the thundering covers of &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Music,&quot; &quot;Honey Don&apos;t,&quot; and &quot;Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!,&quot; and the weariness creeps up in unexpected places -- &quot;Every Little Thing,&quot; &quot;What You&apos;re Doing,&quot; even George&apos;s cover of Carl Perkins&apos; &quot;Everybody&apos;s Trying to Be My Baby&quot; -- leaving the impression that Beatlemania may have been fun but now the group is exhausted. That exhaustion results in the group&apos;s most uneven album, but its best moments find them moving from Merseybeat to the sophisticated pop/rock they developed in mid-career.

In fact, if Alan Parsons lent the Allman Brothers his spaceship, Because of the Times would be the resulting space odyssey. While that leads to some intriguing moments, the general move away from strong, hooky choruses to a focus on expansive, intricate and percussive arrangements may challenge casual and even some longtime fans of the band&apos;s catchy, Southern garage rock twang. That said, cuts like the atmospheric and brooding lead-off track &quot;Knocked Up&quot; showcase lead-singer Caleb Followill&apos;s growing maturity as a singer and lyricist and bring to mind favorable comparisons to such artists as Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen. Similarly, the moody single &quot;On Call&quot; as well as the roiling, dramatic &quot;McFearless,&quot; while not immediately hummable, do sink into your memory revealing layers of melody and emotion on repeated listens.

This stellar collection rounds up all their major European hits, as well as several new tracks, including the soulful single &quot;Testify,&quot; &quot;Dreaming,&quot; and their excellent cover of the Doobie Brothers&apos; &quot;What a Fool Believes.&quot; Also included are early hits such as the funky &quot;Colour My Love&quot; and &quot;How Can I Love You More,&quot; hits from their peak period including &quot;Movin&apos; on Up,&quot; &quot;One Night in Heaven,&quot; &quot;Open Your Heart,&quot; and &quot;Sight for Sore Eyes,&quot; and later hits such as &quot;Angel St.&quot; and &quot;Just for You.&quot; Also here is their epic version of &quot;Itchycoo Park,&quot; which had previously appeared on Bizarre Fruit Part 2. A wonderful, well-rounded collection highlighting the best of one of the 1990s&apos; most exciting (and in the U.S., most under-appreciated) acts. Buyer beware, however, because around the time of this album&apos;s release, a terribly assembled U.S. compilation titled Testify hit the shelves. Spend a few extra dollars and buy this import, because it is miles better than the bizarre hodgepodge that is Testify. As a final note, the versions included here are the edited single versions. ~ Jose F.

In conclusion, it&apos;s interesting to note that through all their trials and tribulations, re-listening to these Cult tracks later, one can garner a finer appreciation for just how far this band has traveled over the years.

For all of hardcore rap&apos;s hysteria over the duo&apos;s gentle demeanor and pop influences, Of the Heart, of the Soul, and of the Cross had been a predominantly rap-oriented album. That changes on The Bliss Album...?, which downplays Prince Be&apos;s rapping (only on about a third of the tracks) in favor of dreamy melodies throughout the songs, not just on the choruses. It&apos;s a logical move, since P.M. Dawn&apos;s most unique moments were often also their most reflective, and they had an obvious knack for crafting original hooks. The Bliss Album...?&apos;s approach also provides more opportunities for the ethereal, layered vocal overdubs that had become one of the duo&apos;s signatures. While the results don&apos;t quite re-envision hip-hop the way the debut did, they&apos;re still tremendously inventive, playing to P.M. Dawn&apos;s strengths. The musical landscapes are even more lushly arranged, and the pop numbers positively shimmer thanks to the duo&apos;s increasing sense of craft. A couple of the more aggressive rap tracks break up the mood a little, as with &quot;Plastic,&quot; a sly rebuttal of the charges leveled by the group&apos;s macho detractors. It seems unnecessary, though, since P.M. Dawn&apos;s cosmic mysticism and vastly different influences clearly aren&apos;t competing on the same turf. Luckily, The Bliss Album...? refuses to acknowledge any artificially imposed purist boundaries, continuing to chart new sonic territory and expanding the possibilities in P.M.

At the same time that songs like &quot;Little Green&quot; (about a child given up for adoption) and the title cut (a hymn to salvation supposedly penned for James Taylor) raise the stakes of confessional folk-pop to new levels of honesty and openness, Mitchell&apos;s music moves beyond the constraints of acoustic folk into more intricate and diverse territory, setting the stage for the experimentation of her later work.

Instead of continuing the colorful blueprint of Crush, they fearlessly backpedal, turning out dull, heavy, serious rock -- the kind of music that sounds &quot;serious&quot; even when it&apos;s about trivial things. Of course, much of the record is given over to &quot;serious&quot; topics, as if the band felt that the events of 2001 necessitated a grave response for Bounce, regardless of what they were singing. Such sobriety would not have been a problem if the band had solid material, but they&apos;re not only lacking songs, they&apos;ve inexplicably altered their musical approach. In particular, guitarist Richie Sambora sounds as if he&apos;s aping James Hetfield&apos;s lumbering downstrokes throughout the album, giving the record an oppressively heavy sound that never lets the music breathe. This casts a pall over the record, but this stumble is not the sole reason Bounce is such a misstep for the band. After all, this is a record where Bon Jovi seems to have consciously decided to avoid everything that gives their music character, melody, and muscle, a move that would have been odd at any point during their career, but is particularly puzzling after they delivered an album that found them growing old gracefully. It&apos;s as if they want to undo everything Crush did for them.

While the dance-pop and adult contemporary ballads on that record were fresher than the music on AmIdol, Clarkson still hadn&apos;t escaped the show&apos;s shadow entirely: since it was a hit so close to her time on TV, it was easy to pigeonhole her as simply a creation of television, not a popular singer in her own right. So, her second album, Breakaway, released late in 2004, was a pivotal moment for her, a chance to prove that she was not a one-hit wonder, a chance to prove that she could have a real, vibrant career. Happily, Breakaway delivers on that promise. This time around, the dance-pop elements have been almost entirely stripped away, and the record instead is a rock-influenced, MOR pop affair, not entirely dissimilar to Ashlee Simpson&apos;s Autobiography, only a little bit smoother and not as heavy on guitars. Since Clarkson is a better singer than Simpson -- not only does she possess more chops, but she has more on-record charisma -- she can sell the material even when the slow tempos in the middle of record drag its momentum; she prevents the songs from sounding too samey. While there may be one too many ballads here, they often are very good and sometimes are excellent, like the light, layered, yearning title tune. Clarkson may be a fine ballad singer, but what gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes like &quot;Since U Been Gone,&quot; &quot;Walk Away,&quot; and &quot;You Found Me.&quot; These are the numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off, and they are the tracks that illustrate that Kelly Clarkson is a rare thing in the 2000s: a pop singer who&apos;s neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream. After a bunch of rather blah mainstream pop albums, including a glut of half-baked AmIdol projects, this is a nice, low-key relief. [In 2005, Breakaway was reissued with a limited-edition enhanced CD that featured live tracks as well as remixes of and the music videos for &quot;Since U Been Gone,&quot; &quot;Breakaway,&quot; and &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes.&quot;] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2004" thumb="/library/metadata/62002/thumb/1445626332" art="/library/metadata/62001/art/1445625914" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62001/thumb/1445625914" originallyAvailableAt="2004-01-01" leafCount="14" addedAt="1438456733" updatedAt="1445626332">

Recorded on a shoestring budget of just $5000.00 with producer Noah Shain, it&apos;s not hard to see why British audiences might have taken Bright Idea to heart more than their transatlantic cousins, such is its obvious debt to the early-&apos;80s rock &amp; roll of the Rolling Stones, the new wave of the Police, and the stadium-sized power pop of Robbie Williams. Indeed, apart from the turgid Bon Jovi-esque MOR of &quot;Already Over,&quot; a more quintessentially British-sounding pop/rock album you&apos;re not likely to find. It&apos;s an homage which works wonders on the likes of chart-topping lead single &quot;No Tomorrow,&quot; which opens with hypnotic pounding beats, spiky guitars, and a flurry of swirling electro synths that threaten to burst into a club-friendly floor filler before settling for a stab at the kind of Anglicised garage rock of the Killers&apos; first album; &quot;Last Night,&quot; which combines Franz Ferdinand-esque guitars, falsetto vocals, and a nagging bassline to create a groove-laden indie disco anthem; and &quot;So Ahead of Me,&quot; which evokes the pogo-inducing ska of the Specials. But less so on &quot;Look Around&quot; a piano-driven tale of heartbreak which is only saved from its corny power ballad tendencies by its anthemic, Snow Patrol-esque final minute, and &quot;Happiness,&quot; which borrows the luscious intro from Super Furry Animals&apos; &quot;Juxtaposed with U&quot; and the guitar hook from the Stones&apos; &quot;Start Me Up,&quot; but unfortunately surrounds them with a pub rock sound that even the Stereophonics might think was a bit too plodding. Packed with sunny melodies, infectious hooks, and an unashamed sense of camp which makes Mika seem shy and retiring, it&apos;s a no-brainer why trilby hat-wearing frontman Jason Pebworth has since gone onto become an in-demand songwriter for the likes of Sugababes and Jessie J. But while Orson might fancy himself the next Mick Jagger, Bright Idea is just a little too derivative to be considered anything other than an over-familiar and disposable attempt at stadium rock. ~ Jon O&apos;Brien" index="1" year="2006" thumb="/library/metadata/61266/thumb/1445626044" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61265/thumb/1445625587" originallyAvailableAt="2006-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438452623" updatedAt="1445626044">

Thus, listen one is as enjoyable as listen five or ten, but probably for entirely different reasons, since unique bits continuously appear from the band&apos;s dream haze of accessibly textured indie rock. From the grainy opening of &quot;Melatonin&quot; that blends into strikingly harmonized male/female vocals, the quartet immediately showcases their innate sense of melody amid textured atmospherics and layers of distortion and fuzz, which all come across as both bittersweet and enchanting. Silversun Pickups take the shimmering dream pop of My Bloody Valentine and filter it through &apos;90s grunge instincts like that of the Smashing Pumpkins -- and it all combines to produce an album that, well, is really freaking good. Vocals are both haunting and sweet, as lead singer Brian Aubert somehow manages to sound like a cross between the Goo Goo Dolls&apos; Robby Takac and the Get Up Kids&apos; Matt Pryor -- in a good way. And for every moment of ominous intensity, the band further manipulates their ethereal antics into moments of pure shimmering redemption. &quot;Future Foe Scenarios&quot; is urgent in a completely controlled way that makes the vocals come off even fiercer over the song&apos;s driving distortion, while exhilarating and spacious cuts like &quot;Lazy Eye&quot; and &quot;Common Reactor&quot; materialize out of clouds of hazy guitars and pensive keyboard with dynamic force that never loses its direction. Though an extremely rewarding listen, proceed with caution: once put into a stereo, Carnavas may become stuck inside for quite a while.

A Universal Music Company." type="album" title="Catfights And Spotlights" parentKey="/library/metadata/58735" parentTitle="Sugababes" summary="Thirteen months before the launch of their sixth studio album, the Sugababes saw monumental success with their fifth release, Change, and its lead single &quot;About You Now.&quot; With its glossy electric feel, the powerful impact that &quot;About You Now&quot; had on the charts only further solidified Keisha Buchanan, Heidi Range, and Amelle Berrabah as three of the most formidable personalities in British pop music. Change was the group&apos;s most accessible radio-friendly release to date, which is why it seems more odd that their sixth release would be so much the opposite. However, odd doesn&apos;t necessarily mean bad, as Catfights and Spotlights, the title of the group&apos;s sixth sampling, stands poised to be the group&apos;s strongest showing to date. While it was never in doubt that the group was one of the new millennium&apos;s most influential girl groups, this time around Buchanan, Range, and Berrabah dive into a new dimension of artistic merit, flashing impeccable songwriting skills and flourishing arrangements thanks to the help of immaculate production, which throws the girl into a retro bodysuit yet never feels stale. After five albums (plus a greatest-hits launch) and ten years in the business, it seemed obvious that the group felt the pressure to hold onto their stake in pop music&apos;s ephemeral market, hoping to make that rare transition from being simply a girl pop group to mature divas, something that even the Spice Girls had trouble doing. In fact, it appears that the ladies hoped to do that by taking the overused idea of soulful retro sounds which plagued 2007 and 2008 and using them as a jumping-off point, creating songs like &quot;Girls,&quot; which are as refreshing as anything new by any artist these days. However, &quot;Girls&quot; operates as a wonderful testament to the power of the &apos;70s at its best. Show-stopping numbers like &quot;You on a Good Day&quot; and &quot;No Can Do&quot; work as shimmering displays of subtle strength, building on the recurring themes of enticing harmonies and vocal showcasing which are seen as the most dominant traits that the girls are showing off this time around. The album is by far the group&apos;s most coherent, mature sampling, and more than a handful of tracks, including &quot;Sunday Rain&quot; and &quot;Unbreakable Heart&quot; seem made with the sole purpose of dominating the adult contemporary chart. Even without fawning over so many other tracks, the number &quot;Every Heart Broken&quot; alone reflects the perfect imperfection that the group boasts. It operates as the group&apos;s single most raw and powerful track to date. While the album lacks the most vainglorious electric numbers which seem to dominate the radio waves these days (simply ask the Sugababes/Girls Aloud knock-offs the Saturdays), Catfights and Spotlights is the true reflection of a girl group&apos;s transition from shallow pop stardom into full-fledged recording artistry, and this album is the clear sign that these girls have reached tenure to the point where they will operate as wildly successful recording artists at any age, at any time. This album is only the beginning of a whole new chapter of the Sugababes musical lifetime, which should be filled with critical acclaim if the music is anywhere near as good as it is right now.

It’s a contest that plays out at least once on each of Ceremonials&apos; immaculately produced 12 tracks. Such carefully calculated moments of rhapsody would dissolve into redundant treacle in less capable hands, but Welch does emotional bombast better than any of her contemporaries, and when she wails into the black abyss above, the listener can’t help but return the call. Bigger and bolder than 2009’s excellent Lungs, Ceremonials rolls in like fog over the Thames, doling out a heavy-handed mix of Brit-pop-infused neo-soul anthems and lush, movie trailer-ready ballads that fuse the bluesy, electro-despair of Adele with the ornate, gothic melodrama of Kate Bush and Floodland-era Sisters of Mercy. Producer Paul Epworth (Bloc Party, Friendly Fires) knows that the fiercest weapon in his arsenal is Florence herself, and he stacks her vocals accordingly, creating a fevered, pagan gospel choir on “What the Water Gave Me” and “Leave My Body,” a ghostly, Phil Spector-ish chorale on the surprisingly Beatlesque “Breaking Down,” and a defiant, uplifting horde of merry pranksters on the spirited “Heartlines,” resulting in that rare sophomore outing that not only manages to avoid the slump, but bests its predecessor in the process.

Its dark, inward-looking, and more mature-sounding songs didn&apos;t wreck their career, but the record didn&apos;t exactly further it. With Chase This Light, the band returns to the straightforward, hooky, and radio-friendly sound of Bleed American and lightens up some in the lyric department in hopes of recapturing its position in the marketplace. They aren&apos;t exactly singing about sunshine and lollipops, mostly love problems and the ills of society, but the cloud of gloom that settled over Futures has lifted. The band is back to following the rough template of Bleed American and the albums that came before it, with a mix of rousing anthems like &quot;Big Casino,&quot; &quot;Electable (Give It Up),&quot; and &quot;Feeling Lucky,&quot; melancholy rockers with singalong choruses like &quot;Always Be&quot; and &quot;Chase This Light,&quot; and sweet ballads like &quot;Carry You&quot; and &quot;Dizzy&quot; (which strangely sounds like an outtake from Def Leppard&apos;s Hysteria). Only the moody and dark (with strings) &quot;Gotta Be Somebody&apos;s Blues&quot; hints at the mature sound of the last album. Chase This Light isn&apos;t Futures, Pt. 2, but it also falls short of being another Bleed American. Partially it&apos;s Jimmy Eat World&apos;s obvious desire to go back to the sound that made them huge that does them in -- that kind of desperate move is rarely successful and it doesn&apos;t work here. Partially it&apos;s the feel of the record. The polished and groomed-to-perfection sound is huge, dry, and airless, the note-perfect and under-control vocals lack passion, and the overall lack of imagination is disheartening. Simply put, it&apos;s a bland-sounding record, which is too bad because Jim Adkins really does have a knack for writing good pop songs. With a little more punch or soul, &quot;Carry You&quot; and &quot;Feeling Lucky&quot; could have been special. As they are, all they can manage to be is pleasant. Only the ultra-light and poppy &quot;Here It Goes&quot; manages to stand out, thanks to its goofy handclaps, synthesized voices, and loose backing vocals. A little more willingness to take chances like this would have served the album well, since the combination of slick sounds, surprise-free arrangements, and pleasant tunes on Chase This Light makes Jimmy Eat World the emo version of Bon Jovi -- that&apos;s to say, nice to listen to and vaguely uplifting, but ultimately empty on the inside. Jimmy Eat World have proven they can do better than this and they may yet, but this album is a true disappointment.

What started off as good-natured posturing turned into the real deal in 2008, though, when “Sex on Fire” and “Use Somebody” helped redefine the Followill boys as the new champions of arena rock. Gone were the songs about transvestites and coked-up supermodels; in their place were Top 40 anthems that swung for the fences, armed with U2-sized guitar riffs and giant, lighter-hoisting choruses. Releasing that sort of album -- the kind that soccer moms blast in the family minivan -- has its downside, too, and Kings of Leon found themselves struggling to prove that they hadn’t forgotten about their older fans. All of this makes Come Around Sundown the most important album of the band’s career, since it gives Kings of Leon a chance to choose which side of their audience they’d like to keep.&#xD;&#xA;The answer? Well, none of these songs are as blatantly commercial as “Use Somebody,” but none have the artsy, Appalachia-meets-London charm of Aha Shake Heartbreak, either. After touring in support of Only by the Night for two years, the guys are acutely aware that loud, booming anthems are the best way to fill a stadium, and Come Around Sundown is engineered to sound as immense as possible. Nowhere is this more evident than in Caleb Followill’s choruses, most of which seem to revolve around sustained high notes, and Matthew Followill’s guitar lines, which split their time between moody textures and cyclic, reverb-heavy riffs. The few diversions from that template are some of the album’s best moments -- “Mary” sweetens the band’s sound with a little doo wop, and “Beach Side” focuses on casting a mood rather than creating a spectacle -- but they’re too scattered to change the &quot;go big or go home&quot; mentality, and the twangy “Back Down South” (which soared during the band’s mid-summer 2010 tour) never quite leaves the ground in its recorded version. All detours aside, this is super-sized, guitar-driven, modern rock pomp, a sort of Only by the Night: The Sequel aimed at those who prefer their KOL songs big and bombastic. Kings of Leon haven’t gotten to the point where “Use Somebody” is their default setting, but it has become their benchmark, and Come Around Sundown attempts to replicate that song’s success while still giving the middle finger to Top 40 radio. Sometimes, it works. Other times, Kings of Leon sound like they’ve flatlined their sound while trying to streamline their appeal. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" year="2010" thumb="/library/metadata/59693/thumb/1445625107" art="/library/metadata/59661/art/1445624955" parentThumb="/library/metadata/59661/thumb/1445624955" originallyAvailableAt="2010-01-01" leafCount="13" addedAt="1438447092" updatedAt="1445625107">

Founding members Grant Nicholas and Taka Hirose had reservations about carrying on without their mate; however, Lee&apos;s family urged them to continue. Nicholas and Hirose and ex-Skunk Anansie drummer Mark Richardson spent most of that year crafting a dark, reflective set of songs. Comfort in Sound is Feeder&apos;s fourth album and a touching tribute to Lee. Featuring Feeder&apos;s most intimate and cohesive material to date, Comfort in Sound finds the group&apos;s peace of mind, but the album as a whole isn&apos;t exactly uplifting. The post-alternative mix of acoustic and electric guitars works with Nicholas&apos; obvious emotional struggles. Moods and tempos are consistent in change, and such moves make Comfort in Sound as solid as it is. From the crunchy licks of &quot;Come Back Around&quot; to the positive energy of &quot;Forget About Tomorrow,&quot; Comfort in Sound waltzes along without getting lost in song and craft. This album was a journey for Nicholas and Hirose. They came out on the other side with a greater appreciation for Feeder and a brand new musical freshness.

A similar sound fuels the rest of Conditions, which takes additional cues from the sweeping, atmospheric strains of Coldplay and Bends-era Radiohead. The music itself is partially responsible for such comparisons, but the most obvious link between the Temper Trap and the bands they so avidly adore is singer Dougy Mandagi, an impassioned tenor who coos, croons, and courts melodrama with all the open-armed enthusiasm of a theater student. He&apos;s a fantastic singer and fairly capable songwriter -- two essential qualities for a frontman who takes cues from the giants of stadium pop/rock -- but he&apos;s also a middling lyricist, concerned with topics that are far smaller than the cathedrals and sweeping landscapes his music evokes. For all its fist-pumping beauty, &quot;Sweet Disposition&quot; seems to be about little more than a late-night makeout session (&quot;Stay there, &apos;cause I&apos;m coming over&quot;), and &quot;Rest&quot; features few words other than &quot;Oooh, baby,&quot; which lose their luster after several repetitions. Conditions runs out of juice during its second half, where the anthems of side A give way to minor-key ballads and rock songs that only pack a medium-sized punch. Album highlights like &quot;Sweet Disposition,&quot; &quot;Love Lost,&quot; and &quot;Fader&quot; are tell-tale signs of a band worthy of scaling the Joshua Tree, though, even if the Temper Trap have some growing up to do beforehand. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/62159/thumb/1445626394" art="/library/metadata/62156/art/1445625993" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62156/thumb/1445625993" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="10" addedAt="1438448391" updatedAt="1445626394">

The complete, 15-song tape of the session -- including a dozen covers and three Lennon-McCartney originals -- has been much bootlegged since the 1970s, and has periodically appeared on piecemeal semi-legal releases (always missing the Lennon/McCartney tunes), but is easily available in its entirety on several different packages. The historical significance of this tape is vast; it illustrates where the Beatles were at this crucial juncture of their career. Less flatteringly, it illustrates how vastly they improved between the time of this audition and their first official album release, Please Please Me, 15 months later. In comparison, the sound here is thin and awkward, rife with tentative guitar phrases, nervous lead vocals, and stiff drumming (by Pete Best, who was still in the band at this point). Keeping in mind that this was never intended for public release, in hindsight one finds a great deal of potential and charm, as well as outlines of their great harmonies. The group ended up reprising a lot of the covers, like &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Till There Was You,&quot; on their early albums and BBC broadcasts in much better versions; they also covered some odd popular standards (&quot;September In The Rain,&quot; &quot;Sheik Of Araby&quot;) that appear nowhere else. Especially fascinating are the three Lennon/McCartney tunes, &quot;Hello Little Girl,&quot; &quot;Love Of The Loved,&quot; and &quot;Like Dreamers Do,&quot; which they never released on EMI, but ended up giving to the Fourmost, Cilla Black, and the Applejacks respectively; the Beatles&apos; versions are much more rock-oriented and much better. ~ Richie Unterberger" index="1" year="2013" thumb="/library/metadata/62493/thumb/1445626491" art="/library/metadata/62447/art/1445626185" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62447/thumb/1445626185" originallyAvailableAt="2013-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438445059" updatedAt="1445626491">

Dig into the details and the deluxe Disintegration winds up seeming a little underwhelming. All the non-live B-sides -- a grand total of four (“Babble,” “Out of Mind,” “2 Late,” “Fear of Ghosts”) -- wound up on the 2004 rarities clearinghouse Join the Dots, so they’re not recycled here. Instead, all the live tracks that were used as B-sides in various territories for the album’s four singles are here, presented as the live album Entreat, which itself was released in 1991 as an easy roundup of these cuts. As an enticement for collectors, this live album is augmented by four previously unreleased cuts, so it is now an in-concert replica of Disintegration, something that is perfectly fine but doesn’t stray much from the original blueprint. The rarities disc contains the first sketches of those blueprints and they’re pretty rough indeed: instrumental home demos, band rehearsals, rough cuts with guide vocals, the kind of stuff that is archivally interesting but not necessarily compelling outside of being history. Frankly, it’s a bit of a slog to get through the rarities disc; it may be fascinating that “Pictures of You” and “Fascination Street” were basically intact as home instrumentals but it doesn’t make for rewarding listening, although it surely appeals to collectors who simply have to have everything, even if they may never listen to it more than once. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2010" thumb="/library/metadata/62313/thumb/1445626438" art="/library/metadata/62312/art/1445626100" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62312/thumb/1445626100" originallyAvailableAt="2010-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438448266" updatedAt="1445626438">

There are two duets here, one with folk artist Jolie Holland and the other with a rather militant-sounding Annie Lennox, but the best material is reserved for Gray alone. He does what he does best on songs like &quot;Transformation,&quot; whose homespun melody is at once warm and utterly heartbreaking, but he also makes room for faster material, from the rhythmic drive of &quot;Stella the Artist&quot; to the casual strut of lead-off track &quot;Fugitive.&quot; Regardless of the tempo, Gray&apos;s voice remains the centerpiece of this album, as his lived-in vocals continue to amass more conviction and grit with age. Those looking for another &quot;Babylon&quot; probably won&apos;t find such commercial appeal here, but David Gray hasn&apos;t concerned himself with the mainstream for years, and Draw the Line is essentially another cog in the folksy wheel he&apos;s been spinning since New Day at Midnight.

At 28, she&apos;s already assembled a formidable body of work, with each recording sounding different than the last, all the while keeping an instantly identifiable sound. This time out she&apos;s working with veteran producer/engineer Malcolm Burn (Chris Whitley, Patti Smith, Lisa Germano, Charlie Sexton, Blue Rodeo, Iggy Pop) behind the boards. King mixes up her attack with seven instrumentals and seven vocal cuts. She plays guitars (including pedal steel), keyboards, and drums, with a small host of collaborators. The sound is warm and full here; there is a sense of detachment that her previous recordings don&apos;t have -- which is part Burn&apos;s trademark sound that he developed while working with Daniel Lanois and part her increasing familiarity with a recording studio. The instrumental cuts work best, of course, since King&apos;s voice is limited in its range, scope, and ability to express the considerable emotional content of her songs. Here too, however, there is improvement, where she doesn&apos;t feel the need to project her vocal so far above the instrumental mix. Still, as a lyricist, no matter how direct she gets, there is a sense of clumsiness and lyric-as-afterthought in tracks that have some real weight, like &quot;Life Being What It Is&quot; and &quot;Saving Days in a Frozen Head.&quot; The album&apos;s final cut, &quot;2 O&apos;Clock,&quot; which details the aftermath of a broken relationship, works best because its words, while simple and delicate, carry more weight than the rest of the vocal offerings here. In fact, for all of its skeletal sparseness, it packs a wallop. On the opposite bookend, King&apos;s opener, &quot;Bone Chaos in the Castle,&quot; is one of the coolest looped-out prog rock guitar tunes in recent memory. Her trademark finger-hammer style of acoustic playing becomes the main part of the rhythm section, while skittering programmed drums and snares, a bassline, and keyboards create the atmosphere as she winds out a simple melody in lead lines that sting despite having the ends rounded off. The mysteriously ambiguous &quot;Sad American&quot; feels more like a demo than a finished tune, but as such, it works. It&apos;s almost an interlude to introduce the pumped-up indie rock that is &quot;Pull Me Out Alive.&quot; Here she accompanies herself with a staggered vocal line, half a beat behind the front one repeating around her verses. The refrain is a big washy, drifty kind of thing where she gets to the top of her range, guitar lines slip in and out, and drums appear on top of one another -- always a popping snare -- and then just as quickly drop out. &quot;Air and Kilometers&quot; is the most interesting cut here. King uses a digital delay, her acoustic, a steel guitar, and a string quartet to achieve her objective. They paint such an elusive, mercurial backdrop that despite the shimmering appearance of King&apos;s layered guitars, it&apos;s solid. This is not a remarkable album by any stretch, although its packaging is -- it contains a punch-out mobile as a booklet -- but it is a further step in the development of a singular and ever elusive artist who possesses a truckload of talent, but is still unsure of which direction to head to realize it all. ~ Thom Jurek" index="1" year="2008" thumb="/library/metadata/65061/thumb/1445628640" art="/library/metadata/65024/art/1445627725" parentThumb="/library/metadata/65024/thumb/1445627725" originallyAvailableAt="2008-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438447021" updatedAt="1445628640">

Robert Plant&apos;s Dreamland -- his first solo album in nearly ten years and one of the best records he&apos;s ever done, either as a solo artist or as a member of Led Zeppelin -- fulfills that simple definition of a covers album and goes beyond it, finding Plant sounding reinvigorated and as restless as a new artist. Part of the reason why this album works so well is that he has a new band -- not a group of supporting musicians, but a real band that can challenge him because they tap into the same eerie, post-folk mysticism that fueled Led Zeppelin III, among other haunting moments in the Zeppelin catalog. Another reason why this album works so well is that it finds the band working from a similar aesthetical point as classic Zeppelin, who at their peak often reinterpreted and extrapolated their inspirations, piecing them together to create something startlingly original. That&apos;s the spirit here, most explicitly on the blues medley &quot;Win My Train Fare Home (If I Ever Get Lucky),&quot; but also throughout the record, as he offers radical reinventions of such cult favorites as Bob Dylan&apos;s &quot;One More Cup of Coffee,&quot; Tim Buckley&apos;s &quot;Song to the Siren,&quot; and the Youngbloods&apos; &quot;Darkness, Darkness,&quot; along with such staples as &quot;I Believe I&apos;m Fixin&apos; to Die&quot; and &quot;Hey Joe.&quot; What&apos;s amazing about this album is that it&apos;s as adventurous and forward-thinking -- perhaps even more so -- as anything he&apos;s ever done. He&apos;s abandoned the synthesizers that have distinguished each of his solo albums and replaced them with a restless, searching band that pushes every one of these songs past conventional expectations (and, in the case of the two strong originals, they make the new tunes sound as one with the covers). Dreamland rarely sounds like Led Zeppelin, but its spirit is pure Zeppelin; this, in a sense, is what he was trying to do with the Page &amp; Plant albums -- find a way back into the mystic by blending folk, worldbeat, blues, rock, and experimentalism into music that is at once grounded in the past and ceaselessly moving forward. He might have co-authored only two pieces here, but Dreamland is a fully realized product of his own vision -- as unpredictable and idiosyncratic, as fulfilling and full of mystery as anything he&apos;s ever released.

The album at times sounds as if it were one continuous song (or set of beats with similar chord progressions) stretched over an hour, which may detract some, but, in essence, is what makes his sonic dreamscape so engaging. It&apos;s at once both dancefloor and chill out material; one of those discs where one can hit the play button, drift into a different dimension, and forget about worldly worries. Dreamland, which is both melancholy and blissful, succeeds in its simplicity. Highlights include the second single, &quot;Fable,&quot; which continues with the same formula he utilized in &quot;Children,&quot; this time using ethereal female chant-like vocals (also included is an instrumental version of &quot;Fable&quot;). By track three, however, the formula begins to get repetitive, and by track four one can start thinking that this album is really only one long, continuous song. Track five, &quot;In My Dreams,&quot; serves to turn things around, utilizing different break beats and a key change towards the song&apos;s finish. That is followed by the album&apos;s true highlight, &quot;One and One,&quot; a gorgeous, touching, dreamy song, featuring tender vocals by Maria Naylar, which also became a massive international hit, and remains one of the most sincere dance songs of its era. &quot;Princess of Light&quot; follows &quot;One By One&quot; and returns to the previous formula, but still manages to remain intoxicating. &quot;In the Dawn&quot; sets itself apart by featuring more straight-up, trance-like beats, and the album ends with the original version of &quot;Children&quot; and the album&apos;s closer, &quot;Red Zone.&quot; Yes, the songs are very similar, but this album possesses a undeniably dreamlike, intoxicating quality, which can be appreciated by young and old, and, if nothing else, is worth it for the magical tracks &quot;Children&quot; and &quot;One and One.&quot; ~ Jose F.

That&apos;s the spirit here, most explicitly on the blues medley &quot;Win My Train Fare Home (If I Ever Get Lucky),&quot; but also throughout the record, as he offers radical reinventions of such cult favorites as Bob Dylan&apos;s &quot;One More Cup of Coffee,&quot; Tim Buckley&apos;s &quot;Song to the Siren,&quot; and the Youngbloods&apos; &quot;Darkness, Darkness,&quot; along with such staples as &quot;I Believe I&apos;m Fixin&apos; to Die&quot; and &quot;Hey Joe.&quot; What&apos;s amazing about this album is that it is as adventurous and forward-thinking -- perhaps even more so -- as anything he&apos;s ever done. He&apos;s abandoned the synthesizers that distinguished each of his solo albums and replaced them with a restless, searching band that pushes every one of these songs past conventional expectations (and, in the case of the two strong originals, they make the new tunes sound as one with the covers). Dreamland rarely sounds like Led Zeppelin, but its spirit is pure Zeppelin; this, in a sense, is what he was trying to do with the Page and Plant albums -- find a way back into the mystic by blending folk, worldbeat, blues, rock, and experimentalism into music that is at once grounded in the past and ceaselessly moving forward. He might have co-authored only two pieces here, but Dreamland is a fully realized product of his own vision -- as unpredictable and idiosyncratic, as fulfilling and full of mystery as anything he&apos;s ever released. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2002" thumb="/library/metadata/59935/thumb/1445625232" art="/library/metadata/59934/art/1445625029" parentThumb="/library/metadata/59934/thumb/1445625029" originallyAvailableAt="2002-01-01" leafCount="4" addedAt="1438447673" updatedAt="1445625232">

James finally released another Aphex Twin record. But for all this record tells listeners, he may still be in retirement. Spreading 30 tracks (most with unpronounceable titles) across two discs, Drukqs sounds less like a major new statement from electronica&apos;s best producer than the results of a Sunday afternoon&apos;s trawl through his hard drive for files he hasn&apos;t released before. Many songs here evoke the feel of recordings long since past, from the quiet ambient techno of his breakthrough, Selected Ambient Works 85-92, to the demonically extroverted programming of Richard D. James Album and the Come to Daddy EP. Stylistically, the record leans toward the later recordings, with many tracks here reprising the off-key melodies and overloaded drum programming of &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; or &quot;Windowlicker.&quot; There&apos;s also little rhyme or reason to the program; James veers directly from a drill&apos;n&apos;bass firestorm (&quot;Cock/Ver 10&quot;) to a delicate piano piece à la Erik Satie (&quot;Avril 14th&quot;) to an acid-techno burner (&quot;Mt. Saint Michel Mix&quot;) with barely a glance backward for transition. Of course, aside from all the criticism, the previously unreleased musings of Aphex Twin are still far more intriguing and solid than most producers&apos; best releases. The opener, &quot;Jynweythek Ylow,&quot; and &quot;Ruglen Holon&quot; are brilliant, inscrutable pieces reminiscent of a rusty, bygone music box or the gamelan music of Indonesia. And a few of the second-disc highlights, &quot;Meltphace 6&quot; and &quot;Taking Control,&quot; chart a middle ground between the emotional ambience of early Aphex Twin and the wracked hysteria of his later work. Drukqs is a sprawling album that defies listeners to understand or enjoy it as a whole, and would&apos;ve worked much better as a fan-only release than the long-awaited return of the techno vanguard&apos;s favorite producer. ~ John Bush" index="1" year="2001" thumb="/library/metadata/60454/thumb/1445625436" art="/library/metadata/60453/art/1445625202" parentThumb="/library/metadata/60453/thumb/1445625202" originallyAvailableAt="2001-01-01" leafCount="30" addedAt="1438450307" updatedAt="1445625436">

But put on your sad sack thinking cap now, because Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place is a contemplative and heady rush of masterful melancholia. Its six songs are multi-minute, slow motion workouts of gentle electric guitar plucks and subtle/sudden washes of percussion -- they&apos;re still instrumental, but as lyrical as anything in the indie rock universe. &quot;Only Moment We Were Alone&quot; turns on a simple, melancholy guitar figure, the drums shifting from insistent catch-up mode to a studied march built to introduce the next layered crescendo. Explosions in the Sky doesn&apos;t shift as suddenly or jarringly on Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place; the quartet has applied more structural predictability this time out, but is still quick about setting the sad butterflies in your stomach to fluttering. &quot;Memorial&quot; is the album&apos;s meditative heart. It begins so quietly, reduced to brittle landscapes of tone. Lightly chiming guitars drift in, like the echoes of church bells off in narrow city streets. Then, like each of the album&apos;s movements, it surges forward in a rush, like the overtures of Sonic Youth separated, dried, and ultimately lengthened in the blistering Texas sun. The final blast of distortion and staccato drumming is Earth at full bittersweet bluster. &quot;Your Hand in Mine&quot; ends things as they began, with a pair of determined guitars picking out a melody that&apos;s both pretty and pretty damn heartbreaking. ~ Johnny Loftus" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/65431/thumb/1445628789" art="/library/metadata/65430/art/1445628090" parentThumb="/library/metadata/65430/thumb/1445628090" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="5" addedAt="1438446721" updatedAt="1445628789">

Despite such a flurry of activity, however, the songwriter found herself dropped from the RCA roster after Happenstance&apos;s release, a move that prolonged the finishing of her second studio LP. Arriving in 2008 on the Warner Bros. label, Elephants...Teeth Sinking Into Heart literally splits Yamagata&apos;s musical personality into two parts -- the first disc, Elephants, pitches its tent closer to the Happenstance camp with lushly textured ballads, while Teeth Sinking Into Heart plays up the singer&apos;s debt to rock artists like PJ Harvey. &#xD;&#xA;The latter CD is the biggest surprise here, as it displays a swaggering confidence that wasn&apos;t as evident on Yamagata&apos;s previous releases. She raises her voice in volume and pitch, affecting a measured snarl during songs like &quot;Sidedish Friend&quot; and &quot;Faster.&quot; The potent set ends with &quot;Don&apos;t,&quot; a weary ballad that recalls Neko Case&apos;s Fox Confessor Brings the Flood and flaunts an expletive-filled refrain. While the song&apos;s lyrics are aligned with the rest of Teeth Sinking Into Heart, its sound still emphasizes Yamagata&apos;s strength as a master of slow-moving, wounded love songs. Elephant furthers that bittersweet style with ten songs (one of them hidden), effectively doubling the size of Teeth. The disc features a gorgeous cameo by Ray LaMontagne, whose Southern croon does a slow dance with Yamagata on the aptly named &quot;Duet.&quot; Like LaMontagne&apos;s most intimate material, Elephant moves in quiet circles, mining Yamagata&apos;s heartbroken past for melodic effect while dressing up her songs in layers of strings, woodwinds, and acoustic instruments. This is where her voice truly shines -- even when it seemingly hides from the spotlight, reducing itself to a cracked whisper while delivering Yamagata&apos;s lyrics. Fittingly, she matches such strong songcraft with equally strong content. &quot;So for those of you falling in love,&quot; she advises during the first disc&apos;s title track, &quot;keep it kind, keep it good, keep it right. Throw yourself in the midst of danger, but keep one eye open at night.&quot; Spoken like a true veteran of solitude and heartbreak, and performed like one of the strongest songwriters to emerge during the early 21st century. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" year="2008" thumb="/library/metadata/64331/thumb/1445627815" art="/library/metadata/64315/art/1445627229" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64315/thumb/1445627229" originallyAvailableAt="2008-01-01" leafCount="15" addedAt="1438447813" updatedAt="1445627815">

Sonically, the band has never sounded tighter. Long exploratory passages are unleashed with amazing precision, detail, and clarity, which only complements the aggressive, abrasive shorter pieces on the album. There is no compromise from any member of the band, with each of them discovering the dynamics of his respective instrument and pushing the physical capabilities to the limit. Topics such as the philosophies of Bill Hicks (eloquently eulogized in the packaging), evolution and genetics, and false martyrdom will fly over the heads of casual listeners. But those listening closely will discover a special treat: a catalyst encouraging them to discover a world around them to which they otherwise might have been blind.

Unfortunately, Escapology makes it sound as though Chambers has already left. Backed by stale songs, formulaic arrangements, and mediocre songwriting, Williams is forced to rely on his volcanic personality to bring this album across -- and despite a few strong performances, he sinks into lame self-parody time and time again. It&apos;s nearly impossible to reflect seriously on themes he&apos;s already broached several times before, as often happens here; &quot;Feel&quot; and &quot;Love Somebody&quot; are the usual looking-for-love songs, the latter with a set of trite lyrics cribbed from 30 years of rock &amp; roll: &quot;Always and forever, is forever young/Your shadow on the pavement, the dark side of the sun/Gotta dream the dream all over and sleep it tight/You don&apos;t wanna sing the blues in black and white.&quot; The Oasis flag-waver &quot;Something Beautiful&quot; finds Williams trying to keep on despite being tired with the modern world, while &quot;Monsoon&quot; and &quot;Handsome Man&quot; chart the usual celebrity regrets with an odd sense of arrogance and self-deprecation that isn&apos;t half as interesting at this point in his career as before. The highlights here are songs that barely would&apos;ve made it onto Sing When You&apos;re Winning (much less his first two albums), and the sound is MOR throughout. Robbie Williams has never been an innovative artist, but previously his strong delivery and sly, ironic wit -- along with savvy production and songwriting -- kept any glimpse of cheese at bay.

Her sound, full of gorgeous tapped melodies and popping basslines, is as deeply emotional as John Fahey&apos;s, as technically savvy as Preston Reed&apos;s, and as energetic as Leo Kottke&apos;s (à la 6- and 12-String Guitar, Greenhouse, and Mudlark). Citing these legendary players is not for the sake of comparison in style or approach, but in metaphor only for she sounds only like herself. King&apos;s thumb over the neck and simultaneous double-handed melody line playing is a muscular approach to the instrument to be sure, but in her melodies. harmonic runs and basslines become checkpoints to the musical cosmos; they are complex, indescribable emotional pathways to the heart as well as the mind. There is no &quot;math&quot; in her playing. She goes too far inside the musical labyrinth for that and speaks like a guitarist whose virtuosity lies not only in her technique -- which is truly and literally stunning -- but in her &quot;singing&quot; voice on the instrument. King is a songwriter for the guitar -- and not like Michael Hedges either. This is the music of luminous motion, where trains, planets, and constellations meet at some interstitial point; where earth and sky kiss lustily. For every workout like &quot;Close Your Eyes &amp; You&apos;ll Burst Into Flames,&quot; where time signatures blur under percussive roils and thumping subharmonies, there are nearly pastoral vistas like &quot;Joi.&quot; The manner of counterpoint used in the title track would make most flamenco guitarists jealous for the way it continually moves further into itself and adds body and dimension to the ground of its assertion. The intimate masterwork here is the closer, &quot;Fortuna,&quot; where shape-shifting genres and guitar styles weave through and around one another to offer a meditation on love, grace, and the willingness to speak instrumentally and vocally of deeper unspecified truths, secret histories, forceful desires, and chimerical states of being before slipping out the back door with intimate, tender, smart-assed humor. If this seems like an unspecific way to tell about this song, it is; here is music so heartbroken, so gloriously individual and fathomless, one can only venture how knotted the heartworm highways of its origin are. Everybody Loves You is the most auspicious, tender, and tough instrumental debut by any guitarist in a decade at least. It is singular in approach and peerless in execution; and in its poetic, raggedly graceful manner, it is simply a treasure of individuality and idiosyncratic virtuosity, visceral truth, and verve.

Tunstall&apos;s Eye to the Telescope will draw initial comparisons to Dido, since they&apos;re both female adult alternative singer/songwriters who bear a certain similarity in their vocal timbres. But as Tunstall&apos;s debut starts to unfold, those superficial connections fall away, as she reveals herself to be a soulful vocalist, a restless musician, and a serious songwriter. At times, she may be on the verge of being a little too serious, as her songs are tightly wound and earnest, two qualities that can seem slightly stuffy when her production has a glossy veneer, as it does on opening songs of the album. These cuts, while accomplished and enjoyable, paint Tunstall as a good but ordinary songwriter, halfway between Dido&apos;s elegantly sleepy soundscapes and Sheryl Crow&apos;s tuneful craft, which is an inaccurate impression, as the album quickly proves. About a third of the way in, the album kicks into gear and Tunstall is revealed as a kindred spirit of such eccentric contemporaries as Fiona Apple and Nelly Furtado. She&apos;s more straightforward than either Apple or Furtado, partially due to the album&apos;s overly slick production, but also in her sober, uncluttered songwriting, yet her musical instincts, along with her impassioned vocals, edge her out of the mainstream. Slower songs like &quot;False Alarm&quot; aren&apos;t sleepy; they have the lazy, jazzy undercurrents of Jeff Buckley and Radiohead, while faster cuts like the single &quot;Black Horse and the Cherry Tree&quot; or &quot;Suddenly I See&quot; have an urgency that makes them compelling, despite the shiny production. But that production is the only drawback on Eye to the Telescope -- it certainly sounds good, it certainly sounds professional, but it may keep some listeners at a distance, since it requires that they look hard to find the unique songwriter beneath the glistening surface. And if they spend the time to really hear what&apos;s going on in Eye to the Telescope, they&apos;ll find a promising, satisfying debut.

The band&apos;s fourth album, Eyes Open, doesn&apos;t fall short from where they left off; in fact, Snow Patrol&apos;s hungry rock sound only gets bigger and better this time around. All guitar hooks and singalong choruses are firmly in place. Gary Lightbody is an underrated frontman. On Eyes Open, he once again writes songs that are from the heart and true to self-reflection without getting too sappy and too overjoyed.

They are the kind of band that embraces simplicity as beautiful and human flaws as art. The lullaby-like &quot;You Could Be Happy&quot; and the passionate buildup of &quot;Make This Go on Forever&quot; are evident of that.

Already a famous female DJ in her own right, Lady Gaga (nee Stefani Germanotta) pulls out all the stops on The Fame, injecting hard-hitting synthesizers and crashing slicks and grooves. From its opening track until it closes, The Fame fails to come up short on funky sounds to amuse fans of this dance genre. However, what carries this album to new heights is the combination of voice and the razor sharp lyrics which accompany it. Gaga&apos;s sound is no different than that of Gwen Stefani, however her coy delivery of each cooing note gives the album a laid-back slick feeling of ease, which meshes with the dramatic beats that back the album up. In addition, the lyrics which feed the album, especially on the desirous &quot;Paparazzi&quot; or the boastful, vain &quot;Beautiful Dirty Rich,&quot; salt and pepper the album with a nasty, club-friendly feeling of fun and feistiness that an excellent, well-produced dance album should have.

Already a famous female DJ in her own right, Lady Gaga (nee Stefani Germanotta) pulls out all the stops on The Fame, injecting hard-hitting synthesizers and crashing slicks and grooves. From its opening track until it closes, The Fame fails to come up short on funky sounds to amuse fans of this dance genre. However, what carries this album to new heights is the combination of voice and the razor sharp lyrics which accompany it. Gaga&apos;s sound is no different than that of Gwen Stefani, however her coy delivery of each cooing note gives the album a laid-back slick feeling of ease, which meshes with the dramatic beats that back the album up. In addition, the lyrics which feed the album, especially on the desirous &quot;Paparazzi&quot; or the boastful, vain &quot;Beautiful Dirty Rich,&quot; salt and pepper the album with a nasty, club-friendly feeling of fun and feistiness that an excellent, well-produced dance album should have.

He sees no difference between pop and avant-garde, high culture and lowbrow trash -- he throws it all together, coming up with completely unexpected combinations. The thrill of hearing hip-hop loops morph into sheets of My Bloody Valentine guitar noise, then into sweet Beach Boys harmonies, is what makes his American debut, Fantasma, such a wonder. It&apos;s easy to write Cornelius off as a Japanese Beck, particularly since his pop songcraft is as impressive as the busy, multi-layered production, but it&apos;s a little patronizing. Cornelius is operating on his own terms, equally influenced by sunny pop (&quot;Chapter 8 -- Seashore and Horizon,&quot; boasting harmonies by the Apples in Stereo), garagey hard rock, and kitsch (the cartoonish &quot;Magoo Opening&quot;). He assembles the parts in unpredictable ways -- the hard beats of &quot;Mic Check&quot; suddenly give way to floating acoustics; &quot;Chapter 8&quot; literally has a tape recorder stopping and starting the different parts -- which is why Fantasma is so intoxicating.

By the time of its release, the group had two number one British singles with &quot;Firestarter&quot; and &quot;Breathe,&quot; and had begun to make inroads in America. The Fat of the Land was touted as the album that would bring electronica/techno to a world-wide audience. (Of course, in Britain, the group already had a staggeringly large following that was breathlessly awaiting the album.) The Fat of the Land falls short of masterpiece status, but that isn&apos;t because it doesn&apos;t deliver. Instead, it delivers exactly what anyone would expect: intense hip-hop-derived rhythms, imaginatively reconstructed samples, and meaningless shouted lyrics from Keith Flint and Maxim. Half of the album does sound quite similar to &quot;Firestarter,&quot; especially when Flint is singing. Granted, Liam Howlett is an inventive producer, and he can make empty songs like &quot;Smack My Bitch Up&quot; and &quot;Serial Thrilla&quot; kick with a visceral power, but he is at his best on the funky hip-hop of &quot;Diesel Power&quot; (which is driven by an excellent Kool Keith rap) and &quot;Funky Shit,&quot; as well as the mind-bending neo-psychedelia of &quot;Narayan&quot; (featuring guest vocals by Crispian Mills of Kula Shaker), and the blood-curdling cover of L7&apos;s &quot;Fuel My Fire,&quot; which features vocals by Republica&apos;s Saffron. All those guest vocalists mean something -- Howlett is at his best when he&apos;s writing for himself or others, not his group&apos;s own vocalists. &quot;Firestarter&quot; and all of its rewrites capture the fire of the Prodigy at their peak, and the remaining songs have imagination that give the album weight. The Fat of the Land doesn&apos;t have quite enough depth or variety to qualify as a flat-out masterpiece, but what it does have to offer is damn good.

As any tabloid follower knows -- and really, in the new millennium we all follow the tabloids whether we like it or not -- Alanis split from fiancé Ryan Reynolds after the release of 2004&apos;s So-Called Chaos, an album that floated joyously on her newfound love, so it&apos;s no great stretch to see its 2008 follow-up, Flavors of Entanglement, as its opposite, a classic breakup record. And it is, filled with songs of heartbreak, anger, and regret, along with a healthy dose of self affirmation -- or at least it seems that way, as Alanis&apos; words are harder than ever to parse, a mangled web of garbled syntax, overheated metaphors, and mystifying verbal contortions all requiring too much effort to decode. In that sense, it&apos;s a lot like Jagged Little Pill, but musically this is far closer to the muddled mystic worldbeat of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, thanks in large part to her collaboration with Guy Sigsworth, best known for his productions with Björk and Madonna. Given his résumé, it should come as no great surprise that Sigsworth gives Flavors of Entanglement some adventurous textures and drum loops, even electronically altered voices on occasion, but this is no dance record; it&apos;s a claustrophobic, cluttered adult pop album underpinned by a hazy new age sensibility, best heard (if not best articulated) on &quot;Citizen of the Planet,&quot; a thick swirling dirge which serves as an appropriate opening salvo for this dense murk, where the music is almost as impenetrable as the lyrics. Coming after the streamlined Under Rug Swept and light So-Called Chaos, this return to insularity is a bit startling yet it&apos;s welcome, both for those who find a personal connection within Alanis&apos; accidentally cryptic confessions and those who like to listen to her ramblings with their mouths agape, as this overspills with emotional and musical dissonance, the kind that made her phenomenal success on Jagged Little Pill improbable and her slow descent into high-end liberal lifestyle music after Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie quite understandable. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2008" thumb="/library/metadata/58218/thumb/1445624517" art="/library/metadata/58170/art/1445624486" parentThumb="/library/metadata/58170/thumb/1445624486" originallyAvailableAt="2008-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438451291" updatedAt="1445624517">

(&quot;Foley rooms&quot; are, apparently, the sound-effects chambers used by those in film.) Of course, anyone expecting crickets and hollers will be on unfamiliar ground, but those who are already aware of Tobin&apos;s penchant for spacious productions and sounds previously unheard in nature will know exactly what to expect. His stated aim here was to bridge the divide &quot;between music that was based purely on sound design and tunes that were written to physically move people.&quot; But that&apos;s nothing new for him -- since the beginning of his career, he&apos;s been one of the best producers at manipulating found sounds into more-or-less danceable songs. Helping him on his quest is a large cast of collaborators, including Kronos Quartet, harpist Sarah Page, and Stefan Schneider of Music A.M. and To Rococo Rot. The music is suitably impressive, and shows -- as it should -- a far wider range of moods and textures than Tobin&apos;s work in the past. With good reason, the most adventurous tracks here (&quot;Horsefish&quot; and &quot;Big Furry Head&quot;) are also the best, showing Tobin stretching himself beyond the usual electronica brainmelt into more progressive territory.

Pepper&apos;s was once again the in record for now hipsters? First, Panic at the Disco dropped the exclamation mark and donned trippy marching uniforms for the psychedelic pastiche Pretty, Odd, now Fall Out Boy follow with Folie à Deux, a record that doesn&apos;t attempt to re-create the sound but the spirit of 1967, when rock bands would try anything on their LPs, especially if it included lots of orchestration. Strings are only one of the accoutrements on Folie à Deux. Fall Out Boy pile everything onto their fifth album: cameos from superstars and running mates, so many that Lil Wayne and Debbie Harry are barely heard; thundering arena rock rhythms and ultra-slick hair metal riffs; hints of soul and R&amp;B; synths lifted from new wave singles and retro hits alike. If only it were done with a modicum of care, it might seem like a crazy postmodern hall of mirrors, but Fall Out Boy are too artless to be postmodern. They&apos;re hyper modern, flitting through the past and present, taking nothing seriously and taking everything they can, cramming so many allusions into their overstuffed songs it&apos;s impossible to tell what is intentional and what is accidental. (Are those crashing chords on &quot;Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes&quot; really taken from &quot;Baba O&apos;Reilly&quot;? Do they realize &quot;I don&apos;t care what you think/Just as long as it&apos;s about me&quot; is from Nirvana&apos;s &quot;Drain You&quot;? Does it matter?) &#xD;&#xA;Uncertainty about FOB&apos;s intentions is a problem intensified by how lyricist and de facto leader Pete Wentz writes every line with a smirk (it&apos;s a wonder he&apos;s yet to title a song with an emoticon) and how singer Patrick Stump treats every lyric as if it&apos;s sacrosanct, never acknowledging that there just might be a pun there. Stump&apos;s one quirk is an unhealthy obsession with Elvis Costello, borrowing so many of Costello&apos;s overheated mannerisms that when the man himself appears for a show-stopping cameo on &quot;What a Catch, Donnie,&quot; it takes a moment to register that he&apos;s really in the studio singing on an overblown song that also features members of Gym Class Heroes and the Academy Is..., and even contains a passing Beatles allusion when somebody sings &quot;Sugar, We&apos;re Going Down&quot; on the close out, just like how John sang &quot;She Loves You&quot; at the end of &quot;All You Need Is Love.&quot; Whether intentional or not, there&apos;s a certain glee to FOB&apos;s pop absurdity because their cheerfully careless genre-bending has no reverence: fitting all these sounds and jokes into a pop song is all a game and it&apos;s one listeners can share, whether they&apos;re playing spot-the-allusion or just succumbing to the sugary hooks clustered within one track. It would be more fun if these hooks were polished into something resembling a constructed pop song -- FOB&apos;s melodic phrases don&apos;t necessarily lead to the next -- and if the production weren&apos;t so brittle and digital. When there&apos;s as much going on in a mix as there is here, there needs to be room to breathe and there is none on Folie à Deux, with every little detail louder than the next. It also might help if Stump for once would realize that he is singing the words of an unrepentant goofball who gave his newborn son a name whose initials are BMW -- everybody else in the band and audience is having some fun, why not Stump? -- but that disconnect is yet another way that Fall Out Boy capture the Zeitgeist of the latter half of the 2000s better than any band: there&apos;s so much going on in Folie à Deux, you either choose to take it all seriously or take none of it. Fall Out Boy make as much sense when heard either way.

Driven by big pop melodies and distorted guitars, Foo Fighters do strongly recall Nirvana, only with a decidedly lighter approach.

Since he recorded the album by himself, they aren&apos;t as powerful as most band&apos;s primal sonic workouts, but the results are damn impressive for a solo musician. Nevertheless, they aren&apos;t as strong as his fully formed pop songs, and that&apos;s where the true heart of the album lies.

Although it boasts a generous 20 tracks, the 2002 compilation Forever Delayed isn&apos;t likely to change that situation, even if it has the lion&apos;s share of their big singles, since a band devoted to sloganeering doesn&apos;t play outside of their province, or era, without some knowledge of their context. Plus, it&apos;s bewilderingly sequenced -- not chronologically, not as a set list, not with the hits loaded toward the front but as if you had all six albums on shuffle play on your CD carousel -- this disc careens between its 20 songs, occasionally gaining momentum through its juxtapositions (the opening one-two punch of &quot;A Design for Life&quot; and &quot;Motorcycle Emptiness&quot; captures the essence of the two phases of the band) but more often illustrating the extreme difference in the band during the Richey James Edwards and post-Richey eras. And though they certainly don&apos;t avoid Richey -- his face is on the cover, he provides the subtext of the band&apos;s entire career -- they do submerge the unsettling The Holy Bible, a record as nakedly honest and disturbing as In Utero, by just including one song, &quot;Faster,&quot; from what is surely their best album. True, its music is too dark to sit comfortably next to the later hits, but without it, Forever Delayed is missing the pivotal point in the Manics&apos; career, especially since Richey was at the heart of their music and worldview, even after his disappearance in 1995. His descent into despair is necessary to understanding the band, and it&apos;s what fuels their two great albums: the harrowing The Holy Bible and the triumph of Everything Must Go. Though Forever Delayed contains many excellent songs not on either, the context is so jumbled the music is somewhat diluted and novices would be better to hear either of those albums first. [Initial pressings of Forever Delayed contained a bonus disc containing new remixes of classic Manics songs, none particularly interesting.

There are some traditional tracks on here -- or possibly traditionally influenced, at least -- but the majority of work is from his own pen. But even the older work has been given a modern acoustic sheen -- you&apos;d barely recognize it as coming from the tradition. There&apos;s a maturity to his own songs that was missing before, a real compassion to a piece like &quot;Riflemen of War,&quot; while &quot;Send Yourself Away&quot; makes for a gloriously tender closer. That Lakeman&apos;s spent time listening to dance music and hip-hop is quite apparent, as a brief listen to &quot;The Colliers&quot; makes clear. But he&apos;s equally at home on softer material. There&apos;s a theme of duty and the implications of fulfilling it running through the album, not just in military terms but also in relationships. With thoughtful, full arrangements that never sound crowded, he&apos;s made the best record of his career. ~ Chris Nickson" index="1" year="2006" thumb="/library/metadata/64090/thumb/1445627627" art="/library/metadata/64089/art/1445627026" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64089/thumb/1445627026" originallyAvailableAt="2006-01-01" leafCount="13" addedAt="1438448010" updatedAt="1445627627">

Take This to Your Grave was urgent at every turn, and though it fit the conventions of its genre, it was bolder and more memorable than the average release on Kung Fu or Drive-Thru. The kids responded -- Fall Out Boy were fast favorites of the online social networks (MySpace), and an endless tour schedule solidified their rep. With 2005&apos;s From Under the Cork Tree, the band fully delivers on their first full-length&apos;s promise. Sure, it nods a little more to the standard dynamics and production tweaks of pop-punk and emo in the mid-2000s -- Cork Tree was produced by Neal Avron, who&apos;s worked with A New Found Glory. But in many more ways it&apos;s the same album as Grave, a youth-intense blast of pop culture reference, pop-punk hyperactivity, and the feeling that we&apos;ll never understand life until Patrick Stump or Pete Wentz tells us about it. And we believe them. Stump is Fall Out Boy&apos;s vocalist and guitarist, Wentz its bassist and lyricist. Wentz&apos; verbiage can be lengthy -- &quot;I Slept With Someone in Fall Out Boy and All I Got Was This Stupid Song Written About Me,&quot; one title goes -- but he has an innate ability to simultaneously acknowledge and deconstruct the mushy emo soliloquy. Temper that with a road-hardened cynicism about band life, superficial love, and the adventure of signing a record contract, and you have lyrics with a point beyond simply acting up or getting sentimental. &quot;Champagne for My Real Friends, Real Pain for my Sham Friends&quot; is blunt. &quot;Yeah we&apos;re friends,&quot; Stump says, &quot;Just because we move units.&quot; But the album also has a current of longing to it, of missing regular life, regular relationships. Musically, Cork Tree&apos;s first five tracks are relentless, with razor-sharp melodies that seem familiar but sound totally unique at the same time. The &quot;Oh! Oh!&quot;s and punchy chords of &quot;Of All the Gin Joints in All the World&quot; are a thrill greater than any Jimmy Eat World album ever; &quot;Sugar, We&apos;re Goin Down&quot;&apos;s half-time shifts are triumphs of tumbling words; and the opening track meditates wryly on all-ages shows&apos; fame. Further, when Fall Out Boy rip into &quot;Sophomore Slump or Comeback of the Year,&quot; summer 2005 will not be able to ignore them. &quot;We&apos;re the therapists pumping through your speakers/Delivering just what you need,&quot; they sing.

Since the Manics deliver these charged lyrics as heavy guitar-rockers, the music doesn&apos;t always hit quite as forcefully as intended. The relatively polished production and big guitar sound occasionally sell the music short, especially the lesser songs, yet the Manics&apos; passion is undeniable, even on the weaker cuts.

Rejected material can become a highlight out of a combination of whatever unusual aspects already exist in a piece as well as the dramatic impact of a newly conceived program flow. Gold Is the Metal is a great example of this since the individual tracks continually present challenges to the listener combined with a sonic magnetism. Pieces seem kooky, out of shape, or severe, but no desire to skip any of the offerings results.

From beginning to end, Good Girl Gone Bad is as pop as pop gets in 2007, each one of its 12 songs a potential hit in some territory. Unlike Music of the Sun or A Girl Like Me, neither Caribbean flavorings nor ballad ODs are part of the script, and there isn&apos;t an attempt to make something as theatrical as &quot;Unfaithful.&quot; There is, however, another &apos;80s hit involved: just as &quot;SOS&quot; appropriated Soft Cell&apos;s version of &quot;Tainted Love,&quot; &quot;Shut Up and Drive&quot; turns New Order&apos;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot; into a sleek, forthcoming proposition, one that is as undeniable and rocking as Sugababes&apos; 2002 U.K. smash &quot;Freak Like Me&quot; (a cover of Adina Howard&apos;s 1995 hit that swiped from another &apos;80s single, Gary Numan&apos;s &quot;Are Friends Electric?&quot;). &quot;Shut Up and Drive&quot; is part of an all-upbeat opening sequence that carries through five songs. Rihanna knows exactly what she wants and is in total control at all times, even when she&apos;s throwing things and proclaiming &quot;I&apos;m a fight a man&quot; amid marching percussion and synthesizers set on &quot;scare&quot; during &quot;Breakin&apos; Dishes.&quot; The album&apos;s lead song and lead single, &quot;Umbrella,&quot; is her best to date, delivering mammoth if spacious drums, a towering backdrop during the chorus, and vocals that are somehow totally convincing without sounding all that impassioned -- an ideal spot between trying too hard and boredom, like she might&apos;ve been on her 20th take, which only adds to the song&apos;s charm. The album&apos;s second half is relatively varied and a little heavier on acoustic guitar use, but it&apos;s not lacking additional standouts. Three consecutive Timbaland productions, including one suited for a black college marching band and another that effectively pulls the romantically codependent heartstrings, enhance the album rather than make it more scattered.

It&apos;s more soulful and pretty well-constructed, sultry without veering into Lolita territory. In short, this is a fine product, a sterling example of immaculately crafted dance-pop and radio-ready ballads. If there&apos;s any problem, it&apos;s that, apart from &quot;Body II Body,&quot; which weirdly appropriates David Bowie&apos;s icy &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; for a seduction number, none of this is particularly memorable without repeated spins. After those plays, it still seems like Gotta Tell You is a little too heavy on filler -- the singles, like &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot; and &quot;Baby, Come Over (This Is Our Night)&quot; are what stand out, along with the slow-burning closer, &quot;Lately&quot; -- but it&apos;s still better crafted than much teen pop, and it&apos;s delivered with conviction by Mumba. It&apos;s not a stunner, but it&apos;s satisfying on its own (albeit ephemeral) terms, and it sets her up well for greater things.

It took them a long time to get up to speed -- it wasn&apos;t until their third album, 1997&apos;s Dude Ranch, that they developed a flair for sugary pop hooks, as evidenced by that album&apos;s &quot;Dammit,&quot; not just their first big hit, but their first memorable song. It was enough to buy them a ticket to the big leagues and their next album, 1999&apos;s Enema of the State, turned into a blockbuster, thanks to the crossover Top Ten hit &quot;All the Small Things,&quot; an incessantly catchy, irresistible slice of bubblegum-pop that sounded at ease sandwiched between *NSYNC and Britney Spears on Y2K radio. This, as Greatest Hits proves, was both blink-182&apos;s blessing and curse: they had the ability to turn out some great pop singles, but when they missed the mark, they sounded lightweight and disposable. This wasn&apos;t just true of their defiantly stupid party songs, of which there were many; even such brooding, angst-ridden teenage melodramas as &quot;Adam&apos;s Song&quot; seem a little lightweight and transient. Of course, the band was helped neither by its crystal-clear, super-slick production -- which was the antithesis of punk -- or by the thin, whiny edge of vocalists Mark Hoppus and Tom Delonge -- which tended to make even serious themes seem like frivolous adolescent concerns. Over the long run, these two factors tend to undercut whatever snotty charms blink-182 may have had, particularly because their writing tended to be hit or miss, to the extent that even this Greatest Hits is uneven. It may have all their best songs -- &quot;Dammit&quot; and &quot;All the Small Things&quot; in particular, plus &quot;Josie,&quot; &quot;What&apos;s My Age Again?,&quot; &quot;The Rock Show,&quot; and &quot;Stay Together for the Kids&quot; -- but at 17 songs, including the previously unreleased &quot;Not Now&quot; and a cover of the Only Ones&apos; &quot;Another Girl Another Planet&quot; taken from the MTV reality series starring drummer Travis Barker and his Playmate wife, this runs a little long. It may have all their charting singles, but its generous length tends to highlight blink-182&apos;s weaknesses instead of their strengths. That said, the group did set the standard for pop-punk&apos;s commercialization at the turn of the millennium, and not only were they better than the sound-alikes that followed, they did have some good tunes, all of which are best heard on this intermittently entertaining collection. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2005" thumb="/library/metadata/60320/thumb/1445625374" art="/library/metadata/60319/art/1445625159" parentThumb="/library/metadata/60319/thumb/1445625159" originallyAvailableAt="2005-01-01" leafCount="19" addedAt="1438457316" updatedAt="1445625374">

Gifted with a disarmingly throaty -- yet still resonant -- voice and attractive, girl-next-door charisma that combines Kate Bush&apos;s cherubic art pop croon mixed with the asymmetrical half-smile charm of Drew Barrymore, Goulding stood out among the sea of post-Imogen Heap synth folk songstresses such as Little Boots, La Roux, and Lykke Li. On her sophomore effort, 2012&apos;s Halcyon, Goulding moves in an even more arty, electronic direction. Where Lights featured a handful of well-crafted singer/songwriter-styled singles such as &quot;Guns and Horses&quot; and the disco-bliss number &quot;Starry Eyed,&quot; Halcyon keeps the singer/songwriter lyricism, but expands upon the electronic and symphonic palette. Aside from a few songs like the gutting, bittersweet piano ballad &quot;I Know You Care&quot; -- which itself brings to mind her smash 2010 cover of Elton John&apos;s &quot;Your Song&quot; -- Halcyon is largely built around epic long-form anthems and shimmery moments of gargantuan synthesizer drama. Tracks like the baroque &quot;My Blood&quot; and lustful club-groover &quot;Figure 8&quot; have a crisp, pulsating electronic buoyancy that, as with all of the songs on Halcyon, vibrate with a palpable dramatic tension. Also in keeping with the arty-electronic atmosphere of the album, Goulding dresses up her powerful lark of a voice with a delicately laced veil of digital effects. She sets these sparkling, multi-tracked vocal sections against roiling arpeggiated grand piano lines, the digital pluck of harps, echoey orchestral samples, and the ever present hum of deep bass synth. Goulding has a strong enough voice that when she toured with the decidedly more rootsy blues and country-influenced American songwriter Lissie in 2010, they brought the house down with several pitch-perfect, soulful duets, so the move toward a more atmospheric, sonically layered approach feels decidedly more like a conscious aesthetic choice. In that sense, she seems to be striking a balance between her more arty inclinations and a kind of adult contemporary, Annie Lennox-style professionalism. Perhaps Goulding illuminates her strong suits best on her enigmatic single &quot;Anything Could Happen,&quot; in which she belts out a kind of post-traumatic affirmation for letting go and moving on to brighter things. She sings &quot;Letting darkness grow/As if we need its palette and we need its colour/But now I&apos;ve seen it through/And now I know the truth/That anything could happen.&quot; An ambitious work by an artist intent on developing her total sound, Halcyon finds Goulding poised at the edge of artistic and career possibilities. ~ Matt Collar" index="1" year="2012" thumb="/library/metadata/57912/thumb/1445624484" art="/library/metadata/57911/art/1445624372" parentThumb="/library/metadata/57911/thumb/1445624372" originallyAvailableAt="2012-01-01" leafCount="21" addedAt="1438448214" updatedAt="1445624484">

It features 13 listed tracks that are either self-penned or written in collaboration with producer John Alagía (John Mayer, Josh Kelly) and mentor/guitarist Kevin Salem. The cuts &quot;Worn Me Down&quot; and &quot;Reason Why&quot; carry over, but they have been completely re-recorded. It is an unabashedly lush, deeply textured pop record that makes no apologies for its radio-friendliness or its adornments. This album&apos;s elegance reflects a willingness to overreach--emotionally as well as in production. Yamagata&apos;s voice is full of elliptical slides and slurs; it swoops, croons, rasps, and whispers; it looks for the crack in a lyric in order to reveal the depth behind it. One can hear that same quality in vocalists such as John Martyn, Billie Holiday, the young Rod Stewart, Dinah Washington, Maggie Bell, and Jeff Buckley. That context embodies within it a certain kind of approach, one that fuses grace with grit, and passion with pathos, but also the slow, erotic burn of control and restraint, where heartache becomes the river on which everything is carried; it is given a voice, an unvarnished utterance. In its grain, phrasing is also a vehicle: for something that lies just beyond the scope of actual words pointing down and in, not out. It contains the pastoral languor of a summer afternoon combined with the emotional intensity of a gleaming stiletto opening a vein. The similarity here is in the quality of performance. Listeners can definitely hear traces of her influences, but these are woven into a fabric that serves the song, not the singer.&#xD;&#xA;These tomes are haunted with the poetry of time-worn ghosts: Unrequited love, dislocation, desire, loss, anger, all drift and hover here, but sometimes, these songs offer the acceptance that allows these spirits to move on.  There is a striking melodic and lyric balance weighted by the tension held between idealism and the sad, world-weariness of an assaulted, oft-betrayed heart. &quot;Worn Me Down,&quot; with its killer U2 hook and deep strings, is the obvious single, but it&apos;s far from the best track here. The new version, with organic drums, spacy keyboards, and Salem&apos;s lead guitar shimmer, would be an anthem were it not for its lyric honesty. The strummed acoustic guitar that introduces &quot;Meet Me by the Water&quot; carries within it the murky terrain between a country ballad and jazzy pop song. In the middle of the track, Yamagata&apos;s piano makes room for Salem&apos;s slide guitar as he places a melody line from Stewart&apos;s &quot;Mandolin Wind&quot; down in the bridge. The lean blue-eyed soul in &quot;1963&quot; offers an entirely different dimension to Yamagata&apos;s vocal prowess that makes it a tough, sensual love song. &quot;Even So&quot; offers its confession of betrayal in a deliberately slow, gradually revealing narrative that cuts deep, revealing the harsh truth in the lyric without artifice. The album officially ends with &quot;Quiet,&quot; a forlorn lullaby that glides into desolation in waltz time. Oliver Kraus&apos; cello and the two pianos carry the melody and vocal lines into a kind of finality that never rules out the beauty of memory or the glimmer of hope that lies in all brokenness, the truth of which is borne out by a final, hidden track. Happenstance is a fine debut offering; Yamagata delivers the full weight of her talent as it now stands. ~ Thom Jurek" index="1" year="2004" thumb="/library/metadata/64316/thumb/1445627819" art="/library/metadata/64315/art/1445627229" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64315/thumb/1445627229" originallyAvailableAt="2004-01-01" leafCount="14" addedAt="1438447840" updatedAt="1445627819">

Nevertheless, that decision still impresses, not only because the album is so strong, but because it was written and recorded at a time when the Beatles were constantly touring, giving regular BBC concerts, appearing on television and releasing non-LP singles and EPs, as well as filming their first motion picture. In that context, the achievement of A Hard Day&apos;s Night is all the more astounding. Not only was the record the de facto soundtrack for their movie, not only was it filled with nothing but Lennon-McCartney originals, but it found the Beatles truly coming into their own as a band by performing a uniformly excellent set of songs. All of the disparate influences on their first two albums had coalesced into a bright, joyous, original sound filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies. They had certainly found their musical voice before, but A Hard Day&apos;s Night is where it became mythical. In just a few years, they made more adventurous and accomplished albums, but this is the sound of Beatlemania in all of its giddy glory -- for better and for worse, this is the definitive Beatles album, the one every group throughout the ages has used as a blueprint. Listening to the album, it&apos;s easy to see why. Decades after its original release, A Hard Day&apos;s Night&apos;s punchy blend of propulsive rhythms, jangly guitars, and infectious, singalong melodies is remarkably fresh. There&apos;s something intrinsically exciting in the sound of the album itself, something to keep the record vital years after it was recorded. Even more impressive are the songs themselves. Not only are the melodies forceful and memorable, but Lennon and McCartney have found a number of variations to their basic Merseybeat style, from the brash &quot;Can&apos;t Buy Me Love&quot; and &quot;Any Time at All,&quot; through the gentle &quot;If I Fell,&quot; to the tough folk-rock of &quot;I&apos;ll Cry Instead.&quot; It&apos;s possible to hear both songwriters develop their own distinctive voices on the album, but overall, A Hard Day&apos;s Night stands as a testament to their collaborative powers -- never again did they write together so well or so easily, choosing to pursue their own routes. John and Paul must have known how strong the material is -- they threw the pleasant trifle &quot;I&apos;m Happy Just to Dance with You&quot; to George and didn&apos;t give anything to Ringo to sing. That may have been a little selfish, but it hardly hurts the album, since everything on the record is performed with genuine glee and excitement. It&apos;s the pinnacle of their early years.

That may be one of the reasons why Hatful of Rain: The Best of Del Amitri was released in 1998, a mere three years after &quot;Roll to Me&quot; climbed into the Top Ten. (It could also be that the follow-up, Some Other Sucker&apos;s Parade, stiffed on the charts.) In any case, Hatful of Rain is an excellent overview of Del Amitri&apos;s career, containing no less than 17 tracks, including all of their American and British hits. It may overlook their early independent singles, yet the consistency of their major-label work in the &apos;80s and &apos;90s gives the collection a sense of cohesion, even if it is sequenced out of chronological order. What matters is that Hatful of Rain contains everything that a casual fan could want while reconfirming their stature as a solid singles band to their core constituents -- and that&apos;s everything a good greatest-hits album should do.

Mayer offers nothing heavy on the follow-up to his breakthrough hit, Room for Squares -- nothing heavy in the music and nothing heavy in the lyrics. No, Mayer is smooth, slick, and streamlined on his second or third album (it all depends if you count his 1999 debut, Inside Wants Out, half of which was re-recorded for Room for Squares, which itself was released in two different incarnations), playing things straight and following the blueprint provided by his big radio hit &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland.&quot; The title Heavier Things does reflect his new directness, lacking the lithe playfulness that resulted in a Hank Mobley joke, of all things, for an album title last time out. That extends to the rest of the album -- the humor and interesting wordplay have been toned down, leaving very little ambiguity. Actually, there&apos;s little left unexplained on the record, with every song spread across several grids explaining where they were written and how many beats-per-minute they are, breaking them down into keywords, charting what &quot;suggested target points&quot; on the body the song should hit (tellingly, not one track is targeted at the crotch), and even grouping the songs together by key. The latter is a bit of a mistake, since it shows that for all those jazzy major and minor seventh chords gliding by in his songs, he&apos;s keeping his songwriting pretty simple, sticking to D, E, F, G, and A, with a G minor thrown in for good measure. This, of course, is not really a problem for listeners, since most listeners don&apos;t care how a song is written as long as it sounds good, but this does confirm that he&apos;s kept things simple, concentrating on how the record sounds and feels. And, as a piece of mood music, this is really quite effective, delivering on how &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot; sounds, with some really nice, lush, laid-back textures and songs that are melodic without being truly catchy. It&apos;s music that floats through the speakers nicely and never leaves much of a lasting impression; it&apos;s how a jazzier, laid-back, less adventurous, and MOR-oriented Dave Matthews would sound. Mayer is now more of a record-maker than a songwriter, which will undoubtedly dishearten those who liked the song-oriented Inside Wants Out, but those who just enjoyed the sound and feel of Room for Squares should feel right at home.

By sounding like an inferior copy of the 1998 landmark Mezzanine, 100th Window broke a string and led to negative reviews. Heligoland marks a return to departures. The sound of Massive Attack circa 2010 has some similarities to what the group has done in the past, but overall, this represents a radical shift in music-making. Granted, most of the Massive Attack hallmarks are still here: gripping music laden with tension and dread, a production that sounds fathoms deep, and an insular worldview represented by a cast of vocalists both new and old. (The new voices include Damon Albarn, Hope Sandoval, Elbow&apos;s Guy Garvey, and TV on the Radio&apos;s Tunde Adebimpe.) What&apos;s immediately apparent, however, from the opener &quot;Pray for Rain&quot; is the sparseness and understated air on display here. With Adebimpe on vocals, the track begins with a rattling of bones and a resigned air whose closest predecessor is &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; by New Order (a group who practically defined the word understated with their music prior to 1982). This certainly isn&apos;t the Massive Attack that floated the smoothest British house of the early &apos;90s, and more surprisingly, it&apos;s also not the Massive Attack that created dense, immersive trip-hop during the &apos;90s and early 2000s. At times, it&apos;s clear that Robert Del Naja and Neil Davidge&apos;s work on soundtracks during the 2000s has adversely affected their main project, resulting in music that skirts the background as often as not. Heligoland often sounds like a soundtrack, most likely the score to some dystopic thriller such as Children of Men or 28 Days Later. The album also isn&apos;t as experimental as the music Massive Attack made in the past. Unlike Portishead&apos;s Third, a classic comeback from their fellow Bristolians, it also lacks the balance of experimentation and emotion (the latter especially has often been a weakness in Massive Attack&apos;s output compared to their peers). True, Horace Andy and Hope Sandoval front some impressive productions, and Damon Albarn&apos;s &quot;Saturday Come Slow&quot; is one of his best post-Blur features (including Gorillaz), but overall Heligoland lacks the majesty and might of classic Massive Attack. ~ John Bush" index="1" year="2010" thumb="/library/metadata/64730/thumb/1445628536" art="/library/metadata/64724/art/1445627510" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64724/thumb/1445627510" originallyAvailableAt="2010-01-01" leafCount="14" addedAt="1438447367" updatedAt="1445628536">

Again, they pad the album with covers, but the Bakersfield bounce of &quot;Act Naturally&quot; adds new flavor (along with an ideal showcase for Ringo&apos;s amiable vocals) and &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzy&quot; gives John an opportunity to flex his rock &amp; roll muscle. George is writing again and if his two contributions don&apos;t touch Lennon and McCartney&apos;s originals, they hold their own against much of their British pop peers. Since Lennon wrote a third more songs than McCartney, it&apos;s easy to forgive a pair of minor numbers (&quot;It&apos;s Only Love,&quot; &quot;Tell Me What You See&quot;), especially since they&apos;re overshadowed by four great songs. His Dylan infatuation holds strong, particularly on the plaintive &quot;You&apos;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; and the title track, where the brash arrangement disguises Lennon&apos;s desperation. Driven by an indelible 12-string guitar, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; is another masterpiece and &quot;You&apos;re Going to Lose That Girl&quot; is the kind of song McCartney effortlessly tosses off -- which he does with the jaunty &quot;The Night Before&quot; and &quot;Another Girl,&quot; two very fine tunes that simply update his melodic signature. He did much better with &quot;I&apos;ve Just Seen a Face,&quot; an irresistible folk-rock gem, and &quot;Yesterday,&quot; a simple, beautiful ballad whose arrangement -- an acoustic guitar supported by a string quartet -- and composition suggested much more sophisticated and adventurous musical territory, which the group immediately began exploring with Rubber Soul.

While Holes in the Wall veers more toward indie and psychedelic rock as opposed to the more straightforward power pop of contemporaries Weezer and Sloan, one of the album&apos;s greatest virtues is its memorable melodies, as exemplified in the catchy choruses of songs like &quot;Empty at the End&quot; and &quot;Silent to the Dark.&quot; The White brothers also have ear-catching production on their side, giving their album true flavor by infusing it with splashes of electronics and keyboards, psychedelic swirl, and the occasional irregular time signature.

His last affair was this 1961 performance of Holst&apos;s The Planets with the Vienna Philharmonic. Recorded in bone-crushing -- but still deep and colorful -- sound by John Culshaw, Karajan&apos;s view of The Planets, like his view of Vaughan Williams and Britten, is decidedly superficial. This is not to say that his conducting is anything less than superb. Karajan was one of great technical virtuosos and he misses nothing in Holst&apos;s monumental score -- not the balances, not the details, not the colors, not the rhythms, nothing. But everything inside Holst&apos;s score is more or less missing: &quot;Mars&quot; has power but lacks point, &quot;Venus&quot; has beauty but lacks soul, &quot;Mercury&quot; has speed but lacks strength, &quot;Jupiter&quot; has weight but lacks humor, &quot;Saturn&quot; has mass but lacks fear, &quot;Uranus&quot; has muscle but lacks wit, and &quot;Neptune&quot; has carefully calculated gradations of dynamics but altogether lacks any sense of blissful departure into infinite space. Despite the superlative but distinctly unidiomatic playing by the VPO, Karajan&apos;s 1961 Planets -- like his 1981 Planets for Deutsche Grammophon with equally unidiomatic playing by the Berlin Philharmonic -- is fit only for listeners who prefer their English music deracinated.&#xD;&#xA;The same cannot be said of Karajan and the VPO&apos;s 1960 recording of Strauss&apos; Don Juan that concludes the disc. As brilliantly conducted and as superbly played as the Planets but with the added advantage of empathic understanding, the Don Juan is as satisfying as the finest ever recorded -- and vastly more satisfying than the Planets." index="1" year="2003" thumb="/library/metadata/64799/thumb/1445628549" art="/library/metadata/64798/art/1445627564" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64798/thumb/1445627564" originallyAvailableAt="2003-01-01" leafCount="7" addedAt="1438447339" updatedAt="1445628549">

The Bay City Rollers this isn&apos;t. On the group&apos;s second full album, Coil continue the refinement of brute noise and creepily serene arrangements into a truly modern psychedelia, from tribal drumming and death march guitars to disturbing samples and marching band samples and back. Balance shares the same haggard, mystic vocal delivery common to fellow explorers of the edge like David Tibet and Edward Ka-Spel, but he has his own blasted and burnt touch to it all. His lyrical subjects range from emotional extremism of many kinds to blunt, often homoerotic imagery (matched at points in the artwork and packaging) and meditations on death. As a result the cover of Leonard Cohen&apos;s &quot;Who by Fire&quot; isn&apos;t as surprising as one might think. Past guest Marc Almond appears again on the track with backing vocals, as well as adding them to &quot;Slur,&quot; which is composed of an unsettling mix of harmonica, bells, percussion and whatever else can be imagined. Other guests include Almond&apos;s then-musical partner Billy McGee, adding a haunting, sometimes grating, string arrangement to &quot;Ostia,&quot; which is about the murder of radical Italian filmmaker Pasolini, and Clint Ruin, aka Foetus, adding his typically warped brass touches to &quot;Circles of Mania.&quot; Paul Vaughan narrates the lyrics on &quot;The Golden Section,&quot; creating a stunning piece that in its combination of demonic imagery and sweeping, cinematic arrangements holds a common ground with In the Nursery. All the guests help contribute to the album&apos;s overall effect, but this is Coil&apos;s own vision above all else, eschewing easy cliches on all fronts to create unnerving, never easily digested invocations of musical power. ~ Ned Raggett" index="1" year="1988" thumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" art="/library/metadata/61395/art/1445625678" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" originallyAvailableAt="1988-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438445527" updatedAt="1445628821">

Jimmy Page&apos;s riffs rely on ringing, folky hooks as much as they do on thundering blues-rock, giving the album a lighter, more open atmosphere. While the pseudo-reggae of &quot;D&apos;Yer Mak&apos;er&quot; and the affectionate James Brown send-up &quot;The Crunge&quot; suggest that the band was searching for material, they actually contribute to the musical diversity of the album. &quot;The Rain Song&quot; is one of Zep&apos;s finest moments, featuring a soaring string arrangement and a gentle, aching melody. &quot;The Ocean&quot; is just as good, starting with a heavy, funky guitar groove before slamming into an a cappella section and ending with a swinging, doo wop-flavored rave-up. With the exception of the rampaging opening number, &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; the rest of Houses of the Holy is fairly straightforward, ranging from the foreboding &quot;No Quarter&quot; and the strutting hard rock of &quot;Dancing Days&quot; to the epic folk/metal fusion &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away.&quot; Throughout the record, the band&apos;s playing is excellent, making the eclecticism of Page and Robert Plant&apos;s songwriting sound coherent and natural.&#xD;&#xA;[Led Zeppelin launched a massive, Jimmy Page-supervised reissue campaign in 2014, where each of their studio albums was remastered and then expanded with a bonus disc of alternate versions (in the case of the super deluxe editions, they were also supplemented by vinyl pressings and a massive hardcover book). The supplemental disc for Houses of the Holy is constructed as a mirror image of the finished album, consisting of nothing but alternate mixes and sometimes instrumentals. The cuts without vocals are the most compelling: on &quot;No Quarter,&quot; it&apos;s possible to hear Zeppelin build their sense of mystery, and by stripping &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; and &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; to nothing but six strings, admiration for how Jimmy Page assembled his guitar army only grows. Elsewhere, &quot;The Rain Song&quot; doesn&apos;t seem to float as lithely and &quot;The Crunge,&quot; &quot;Dancing Days,&quot; and &quot;The Ocean&quot; all feel leaner, relying on tight propulsion instead of a Technicolor onslaught. Such differences are interesting but, as with the accompanying bonus disc to IV, this Houses of the Holy supplement ultimately confirms that Page and Zeppelin made the right choices the first time around.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1973" thumb="/library/metadata/64969/thumb/1445627624" art="/library/metadata/64885/art/1445627605" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64885/thumb/1445627605" originallyAvailableAt="1973-01-01" leafCount="8" addedAt="1438447201" updatedAt="1445627624">

Like &quot;Chasing Cars,&quot; the mega-single from Snow Patrol&apos;s previous album, tracks like &quot;Take Back the City&quot; and &quot;If There&apos;s a Rocket Tie Me to It&quot; are slyly repetitive -- their hooks are cyclic, each comprising only a handful of notes, and their straightforward familiarity helps maximize the songs&apos; singalong potential. But A Hundred Million Suns also features more curve balls than the band&apos;s past catalog, from &quot;Lifeboats&quot; (an icy love song with synthesizer glissandos and falsetto harmonies) to &quot;The Golden Floor,&quot; whose handclap-and-stomp intro recalls the light hip-hop flavor of OneRepublic&apos;s &quot;Apologize.&quot; This is where Snow Patrol sound best -- at the intersection between marketable pop/rock and something more challenging, whether it&apos;s an unexpected arrangement or an interesting melodic turn. &#xD;&#xA;The band&apos;s appeal also owes a good deal to Gary Lightbody, who maintains his status as the least famous frontman of a very famous band. He&apos;s the boy next door, a musical Everyman who&apos;s just as average looking as Chris Martin and only half as desperately self-effacing. Looks may have little to do with an artist&apos;s music, but such appearances help ground Snow Patrol&apos;s music, even while &quot;Take Back the City&quot; and &quot;Please Take These Photos from My Hands&quot; reach for the same stars that U2 routinely grab. When A Hundred Million Suns focuses on music -- not saccharine radio fodder like &quot;Chasing Cars,&quot; but actual music, with twists and turns that haven&apos;t been mapped out by generations of likeminded balladeers -- the album warrants Snow Patrol&apos;s existing fame, presenting a band that aspires to pop/rock grandeur without developing the accompanying ego. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" year="2008" thumb="/library/metadata/58873/thumb/1445624768" art="/library/metadata/58857/art/1445624696" parentThumb="/library/metadata/58857/thumb/1445624696" originallyAvailableAt="2008-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438456189" updatedAt="1445624768">

It&apos;s a gimmick, of course -- a flimsy one. Revealed through interviews in 2005, Sasha was said to be Beyoncé&apos;s &quot;stage persona,&quot; an embodiment of the outgoing, aggressive, on-stage Beyoncé that doesn&apos;t necessarily represent the real Beyoncé. Sasha now has a last name (possibly picked up from Tyra Banks, who maybe took a cue from Klymaxx), and is granted half an album (the second disc) to express herself. These five songs, when compared to the majority of B&apos;day, are actually less fun, less impulsive, and yes, less fierce. &quot;Diva,&quot; a variation on Lil Wayne&apos;s &quot;A Milli,&quot; is the only track that could go toe to toe with the likes of B&apos;day&apos;s &quot;Freakum Dress&quot; or &quot;Ring the Alarm,&quot; at least in terms of audacity. At the other end is &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),&quot; a dire &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot; retread. Otherwise, the Sasha Fierce half is full of decent, if easily forgettable, upbeat pop. If placed within the context of an album without a packaging ploy, there&apos;d be little evidence that Beyoncé is making a radical progression or being any more bold than before. It would, if anything, be notable as the least R&amp;B-oriented batch of songs she has made -- that is, if it wasn&apos;t for the I Am half, essentially a small set of adult contemporary ballads. Acoustic guitars, pianos, strings, contemplative soul searching, and grand sweeping gestures fill it out, with more roots in &apos;70s soft rock than soul. Beyoncé feels each line to the fullest extent, which almost rescues the set&apos;s staidness. &quot;If I Were a Boy,&quot; while sounding like the watery backdrop for a singing competition finale, turns out to be the album&apos;s standout, both for its lyrics and Beyoncé&apos;s tormented performance. It could have been the song that broke an unfairly neglected adult-R&amp;B singer like Heather Headley into the mainstream, and don&apos;t be surprised if a country artist nabs a CMA Award by covering it. ~ Andy Kellman" index="1" year="2008" thumb="/library/metadata/60418/thumb/1445625524" art="/library/metadata/60417/art/1445625264" parentThumb="/library/metadata/60417/thumb/1445625264" originallyAvailableAt="2008-01-01" leafCount="20" addedAt="1438456406" updatedAt="1445625524">

Several of the tracks are instrumentals, including &quot;Certified,&quot; &quot;Love Souvenir&quot; (a cool, end-of-the-evening jazzy number), and the title track, although this does have a monologue of Harris explaining how and when he really did create disco. &quot;Traffic Cops&quot; is less than a minute of honking horns, but if you thought that was short, blink once and you would certainly miss the track &quot;Vault Character,&quot; eight seconds long with just four electronic notes down the scale. Harris doesn&apos;t need to sing -- his electronic noises from the keyboard are quite sufficient -- but when he does sing there is a hint of the accent and attitude of the Streets&apos; Mike Skinner, especially on &quot;Colours&quot; as he sings &quot;I don&apos;t care what you dress like or what you wear/But please make sure baby you&apos;ve got some colours in there,&quot; and his rhyming of the title phrase from &quot;Neon Rocks&quot; with &quot;pink socks,&quot; which comes with a reminder: &quot;Stop me if I&apos;ve said it before/I keep my secret stash in the drawer.&quot; In keeping with the gaudy neon disco theme, the album was also released as a limited edition with a glow-in-the-dark cover.

Perhaps this downturn in sales was due to the harder rock direction she pursued on Try This, perhaps the songs she co-wrote with Rancid&apos;s Tim Armstrong weren&apos;t quite pop even if they were poppy, perhaps it was just a matter of timing, but the album just didn&apos;t click with a larger audience, through no fault of the music, which was the equal to that on M!ssundaztood. When faced with such a commercial disappointment, some artists would crawl back to what made them a star, but not Pink. Although she does pump up the dance on 2006&apos;s I&apos;m Not Dead, it&apos;s way too simple to call the album a return to &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; -- Pink is far too complex to do something so straightforward.

She&apos;ll try anything, and she does on I&apos;m Not Dead. It Ping-Pongs between dense dancefloor anthems and fuzzy power pop, acoustic folk-rock and anthemic power ballads, hard rock tunes powered by electronic beats and dance tunes sung with the zeal of a rocker. It&apos;s not just that Pink tries a lot of different sounds, it&apos;s that she seizes the freedom to hurl insults at both George W. Bush and a sleazoid who tried to pick her up at a bar, or to end a chorus with a chant of &quot;Ice cream, ice cream/We all want ice cream.&quot; Far from sounding cow-towed by the reaction to Try This, Pink sounds liberated, making music that&apos;s far riskier and stranger than anything else in mainstream pop in 2006. And it&apos;s a testament to her power as both a musician and a persona that for this record, even though she&apos;s working with singer/songwriter Butch Walker, Max Martin, and Teddy Geiger&apos;s cohort, Billy Mann -- her most mainstream collaborators since LA Reid and Babyface helmed her 2000 debut, Can&apos;t Take Me Home -- she sounds the strangest she ever has, and that&apos;s a positively thrilling thing to hear. That&apos;s because she not only sounds strange, she sounds stronger as a writer and singer, as convincing when she&apos;s singing the bluesy, acoustic &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; as when she&apos;s taunting and teasing on &quot;Stupid Girls&quot; or &quot;U + Ur Hand&quot; or when she&apos;s singing a propulsive piece of pure pop like &quot;Leave Me Alone (I&apos;m Lonely).&quot; In other words, she sounds complex: smart, funny, sexy, catchy, and best of all, surprising and unpredictable. This is the third album in a row where she&apos;s thrown a curve ball, confounding expectations by delivering a record that&apos;s wilder, stronger, and better than the last. And while that&apos;s no guarantee that I&apos;m Not Dead will be a bigger hit than Try This, at least it&apos;s proof positive that there are few pop musicians more exciting in the 2000s than Pink. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2006" thumb="/library/metadata/61249/thumb/1445626094" art="/library/metadata/61232/art/1445625615" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61232/thumb/1445625615" originallyAvailableAt="2006-01-01" leafCount="15" addedAt="1438451523" updatedAt="1445626094">

LaValle&apos;s first two full-lengths as the Album Leaf were gorgeous and meditative, putting him in perfect company with Sigur Rós; his best pieces, including &quot;Wet the Day&quot; from One Day I&apos;ll Be on Time, possessed a quiet, unchanging stillness that neatly connected the dots between ambient legends Claude Debussy, Cluster, Roger Eno, Oval, and Sigur Rós themselves. In a Safe Place, however, includes no magic to compare to his earlier work. The album is exactly the sum of its parts, perhaps less, and definitely no more. LaValle retains his heavily textural, impressionist flair, but has begun to repeat himself heavily, with none of the freshness or vigor of previous material. He also sacrifices nearly all of the record&apos;s precious atmosphere by insisting on a basic drum kit track to drive many of the tracks (though later in the record, he turns to a skittery digital percussion that favor these songs). Only one piece hints at the record&apos;s full power, &quot;Over the Pond,&quot; on which LaValle plays a simple, slightly changing Satie line on keyboards while the full Sigur Rós trio are heard for the first time, playing up their brand of studied melancholy with help from cello and violin. The only other notable success is &quot;On Your Way,&quot; which features LaValle with Pall Jenkins, his collaborator in the Black Heart Procession.

Rolling electronic percussion blends with simple and solid live drumming to provide an understated backbeat as perennial Tree leader Steven Wilson pastes his complicated pop over the proceedings. Wilson&apos;s ability to bury his layered vocals in mountains of spacy electric guitar without drowning out his fragile lyrics is still a valued feature of the music, and the rare moments of clarity that his vocals display are breathtaking in their power. A reliance on a somewhat gothic heavy metal sound makes for some bizarre moments, especially when held up against his gentler material. The best example of this is the chugging &quot;Wedding Nails,&quot; which recalls Dream Theater in its grandiose scope without utilizing the same sort of technical wizardry. But Wilson manages to bridge the gap between the various genres he utilizes, creating an environment where his haunting melodies could take a drastic turn at any minute. Porcupine Tree also continue their Radiohead fascination, although the influence is much less direct than on their last few efforts. Instead, it comes through at odd intervals, like the moments of sparse instrumentation on the otherwise lush &quot;Heartattack in a Lay By.&quot; Sonically gorgeous and deceivingly complex, In Absentia has the most immediate appeal of anything Wilson has released under this moniker up to this point. By keeping the songs at manageable lengths and avoiding the avant-garde electronica flourishes of the band&apos;s early days, Porcupine Tree has grown into a fully realized pop group without cutting any of the elements that also make them an important force in the neo-prog movement.

As every rock critic in the Western world has said in his review of the album, they originally released the record in Europe, then decided it was crap, withdrew it, re-recorded it with a live band, and then released it worldwide. Now this story is probably true -- as the first album by the band driven by the powerhouse production team the Neptunes (though these are not interchangeable terms, as they went to great lengths to make clear in the promo interviews), there was a lot riding on this record, so it had better be right -- but it certainly helped them get valuable press, elevating this record to a near-event level. So, is In Search Of... worth the hoopla? Well, pretty much. Musically, it&apos;s a lively affair, breaking free of the signature approximated-Prince beats, as they borrow heavily from classic soul, breakbeat aesthetics, and postmodern alt-culture, tying it together with live beats. It pretty much deliberately does everything that most modern rap does not do, and it&apos;s hard not to embrace it for that very fact. Alas, there are flaws, mainly in the raps, which are hardly as nimble as the music; actually, they&apos;re rather clumsy and embarrassing, especially since they attempt to cover &quot;socially relevant&quot; issues (i.e., politicians are equated with strippers). Choruses that croon that &quot;She needs me/Because I&apos;m the sh*t&quot; are hard to stomach, no matter how supple the music is (or how ironic the delivery), but if you can ignore that, In Search Of... does provide genuine musical thrills. Although, be forewarned -- it&apos;s easy to overrate this record simply because it deviates from the norm at a time when nobody deviates from the norm or has deviated from the norm in years. With better lyrics and a little less smirking hipsterism, it could have been the record it was intended to be, but as it stands, it&apos;s still a pretty terrific listen and one of the most adventurous, intriguing hip-hop albums in a long, long time. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2002" thumb="/library/metadata/64554/thumb/1445628245" art="/library/metadata/64553/art/1445627421" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64553/thumb/1445627421" originallyAvailableAt="2002-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438447502" updatedAt="1445628245">

The complete, 15-song tape of the session -- including a dozen covers and three Lennon-McCartney originals -- has been much bootlegged since the 1970s, and has periodically appeared on piecemeal semi-legal releases (always missing the Lennon/McCartney tunes), but is easily available in its entirety on several different packages. The historical significance of this tape is vast; it illustrates where the Beatles were at this crucial juncture of their career. Less flatteringly, it illustrates how vastly they improved between the time of this audition and their first official album release, Please Please Me, 15 months later. In comparison, the sound here is thin and awkward, rife with tentative guitar phrases, nervous lead vocals, and stiff drumming (by Pete Best, who was still in the band at this point). Keeping in mind that this was never intended for public release, in hindsight one finds a great deal of potential and charm, as well as outlines of their great harmonies. The group ended up reprising a lot of the covers, like &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Till There Was You,&quot; on their early albums and BBC broadcasts in much better versions; they also covered some odd popular standards (&quot;September In The Rain,&quot; &quot;Sheik Of Araby&quot;) that appear nowhere else. Especially fascinating are the three Lennon/McCartney tunes, &quot;Hello Little Girl,&quot; &quot;Love Of The Loved,&quot; and &quot;Like Dreamers Do,&quot; which they never released on EMI, but ended up giving to the Fourmost, Cilla Black, and the Applejacks respectively; the Beatles&apos; versions are much more rock-oriented and much better. ~ Richie Unterberger" index="1" year="1989" thumb="/library/metadata/63164/thumb/1445626375" art="/library/metadata/62447/art/1445626185" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62447/thumb/1445626185" originallyAvailableAt="1989-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438444799" updatedAt="1445626375">

Their debut was a commanding snapshot of a young band whose emotional urgency outweighed its slavish devotion to the sounds of late-&apos;70s/early-&apos;80s Manchester -- there was no getting around singer Tom Smith&apos;s similarity to Ian Curtis -- but the power and passion of the songs trumped any &quot;British Interpol&quot; accusations. The follow-up found the band falling victim to the dread sophomore jinx, turning out a lackluster rehash of the same ideas as the debut. Ironically, it sold better than the first. Whether or not the band recognized they had come to a musical dead-end despite their booming sales, they were apparently wise enough to know it was time for a change in direction, and they decided to take a rather drastic left turn for their third outing. They&apos;ve by and large ditched the guitars in favor of synthesizers, for a sound that&apos;s more New Order/Ultravox sleek than post-punk scrappy. If you open your mind up wide enough, you can draw a parallel to Van Halen&apos;s 1984 -- the sound of a guitar band getting its synth on but retaining its musical identity. While the shift to an electronic approach opens up more possibilities for the band in terms of dynamics, arrangements, and melodic contours -- there&apos;s a noticeable slant towards catchy refrains rather than billowing atmosphere -- this is still very obviously an Editors album. Smith&apos;s Curtis-like tones still boom out authoritatively, and the ominous intensity of old is a constant presence. And while it seems they will probably never equal the majesty of their debut, Editors have dug themselves out of their artistic cul de sac at least long enough to plan their next move. ~ J.

A good deal of this aural adventurism derived from internal tensions within the band. Jimmy Page and John Bonham were in the throes of their own addictions, leaving Plant and John Paul Jones alone in the studio to play with the bassist&apos;s new keyboard during the day. Jones wound up with writing credits on all but one of the seven songs -- the exception is &quot;Hot Dog,&quot; a delightfully dirty rockabilly throwaway -- and he and Plant are wholly responsible for the cloistered, grooving &quot;South Bound Saurez&quot; and &quot;All My Love,&quot; a synth-slathered ballad unlike anything in Zeppelin&apos;s catalog due not only to its keyboards but its vulnerability. What&apos;s striking about In Through the Out Door is how the Plant-Jones union points the way toward their respective solo careers, especially that of the singer&apos;s: his 1982 debut Pictures at Eleven follows through on the twilight majesty of &quot;In the Evening&quot; and particularly &quot;Carouselambra,&quot; which feels like Plant and Jones stitched together every synth-funk fantasy they had into a throttling ten-minute epic. With its carnivalesque rhythms, &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot; also suggests the adventurousness of Plant, but it&apos;s also an effective showcase for Bonham -- it&apos;s a monster groove -- and Page, whose multi-octave solo is among his best. Elsewhere, the guitarist colors with shade and light quite effectively, but only the slow, slumbering closer &quot;I&apos;m Gonna Crawl&quot; feels like his, a throwback to Zeppelin&apos;s past on an album that suggests a future that never materialized for the band.

Into the Blue Again proves, as its 2004 predecessor did as well, that the Album Leaf is also becoming one of the tamest acts in indie rock. LaValle is a musical craftsman, and his productions are thoughtful, economical and warm (most of the record was performed by him alone). Like Sigur Rós, whose studio and string section he&apos;s used in the past, LaValle understands the power of muted arrangements, of ringing chords, and of drawing out those chords to exactly the right length before repeating them or moving on. These elements could have easily resulted in a great record, but Into the Blue Again isn&apos;t great, or even very good. While ambient music with relatively straight-ahead percussion has been a mainstay of indie music from Eno to Black Dog to Sigur Rós themselves, those who have excelled with it have had something interesting to focus on, such as Eno&apos;s melodic sense, Black Dog&apos;s otherworldly effects, or Sigur Rós&apos; unorthodox instrumentation and use of building dynamics. LaValle&apos;s take on ambient music isn&apos;t particularly diverting; his melodies are broad and familiar, his drum programming is bland and bar-band-formulaic (that applies also to his compatriot here, Telefon Tel Aviv&apos;s Joshua Eustis), and his vocals are depressive and resigned. Most of Into the Blue Again is instrumental, and it serves well as background music -- never sticking out, floating by the listener -- but unlike his earlier recordings, there&apos;s little here that rewards close listening.

Her quips are precise in her lyrics and savage in public, as evidenced when she drunkenly baited her co-presenter Elton John at a British awards show. Such displays tend to obscure her considerable skills as a storyteller, a gift that also gets buried beneath tabloid headlines that place her among pop tarts and princesses. Lily is attracted and repelled by fame, adoring the limelight but neither the company or how it forces personal problems to the forefront, and all these contradictions fuel her second album, It&apos;s Not Me, It&apos;s You. &#xD;&#xA;Like many a bright pop star before her, Allen is feeling a little bit older than her 23 years, knowing that the landscape of her life is changing, and she&apos;s dreading her 30s, which still feel very far away. Lily doesn&apos;t state this outright, of course: she puts it into the character sketch of &quot;22,&quot; just like how she deals with the blizzard of cocaine and pills on &quot;Everyone&apos;s at It,&quot; registering her sneering disdain for a social scene she&apos;s outgrowing yet not quite ready to leave behind. Far from being a crutch, this narrative distancing is Lily&apos;s strength: unlike so many of her too-sensitive peers, she doesn&apos;t indiscriminately spill emotions onto the page, she picks her targets, choosing to reveal personal secrets we already know -- tellingly, she never addresses her 2008 miscarriage, but happily serves up her dysfunctional relationships with her parents, something that has provided endless column inches in gossip rags.

Bush kiss-off &quot;F*** You&quot; -- or even &quot;Not Fair,&quot; a cousin to &quot;Not Big,&quot; where Allen laments a lover who is perfect in every way except his inability to make her scream -- the key to any story is how it&apos;s told, and telling is Lily&apos;s strength, how she ferrets out bypassed details or delivers a well-worn punchline. It&apos;s Not Me pushes this talent to the forefront, in part because she works with only one collaborator here: Greg Kurstin, half of the Bird and the Bee and responsible for several cuts on Alright, Still but not the big hits &quot;Smile&quot; and &quot;LDN,&quot; which were produced by Mark Ronson. Without Ronson, Lily isn&apos;t quite so glitzy or glammy, she even flirts with adult pop without succumbing to tedium. Kurstin doesn&apos;t avoid pop hooks or cheeky camp -- &quot;F*** You&quot; galumphs by on a two-step, &quot;He Wasn&apos;t There&quot; is music hall pastiche, and &quot;Never Gonna Happen&quot; gives Lily plenty of room to be coyly disingenuous -- but It&apos;s Not Me, It&apos;s You streamlines Allen&apos;s eccentricities and bad habits, holding together in a way the gloriously messy Alright, Still never quite managed. There&apos;s a slight drawback to this cohesion -- It&apos;s Not Me never hits heights as blinding as &quot;Smile&quot; or &quot;LDN&quot; -- but this approach does wind up spotlighting just how special a pop star Lily Allen is, how she captures all that&apos;s wretched and glorious about her time without falling into any of its traps, probably because she&apos;s clever enough to avoid them in the first place. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/59600/thumb/1445625087" art="/library/metadata/59599/art/1445624935" parentThumb="/library/metadata/59599/thumb/1445624935" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438454747" updatedAt="1445625087">

Unlike the Fratellis, the Pigeon Detectives, and the Enemy, who all struggled to capitalize on their initial success with their second albums, the Twang have changed direction slightly with the follow-up to their Top Five debut, Love It When I Feel Like This. Thankfully, Jewellery Quarter replaces the loud, laddish, and sometimes obnoxious attitude of their first album with a softer, sensitive, and altogether more radio-friendly sound that should finally dispel the Happy Mondays comparisons once and for all. Indeed, lead single &quot;Barney Rubble,&quot; full of jangly guitars and Latino rhythms, proves the band is much more convincing when it steps outside its baggy revivalist comfort zone. Elsewhere, &quot;May I Suggest&quot; and &quot;Got No Interest&quot; are melodic bittersweet ballads reminiscent of their only Top Ten hit, &quot;Either Way&quot;; &quot;Twit Twoo&quot; is a Reverend and the Makers-esque slice of synth-led indie pop; and &quot;Williamsburg&quot; is a more than competent attempt at subtle, brooding folk-pop. Lead vocalist Phil Etheridge&apos;s West Midlands tones, still as distinct as the Proclaimers&apos; Scottish, John Power&apos;s Scouse, and Cerys Matthews&apos; Welsh, can grate over a whole album, but on tracks like the breezy, acoustic &quot;Encouraging Sign,&quot; perfectly complement Martin Saunders&apos; more harmonious vocals. Unfortunately, old habits die hard and the likes of &quot;Put It on the Dancefloor&quot; and &quot;Back Where We Started&quot; revert back to the more familiar derivative Danny Dyer movie soundtrack-style terrace songs. However, Jewellery Quarter is a much more palatable listen than their debut, and with several potential singles, it gives them a fighting chance of avoiding the ever-growing British guitar group scrapheap. ~ Jon O&apos;Brien" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/62088/thumb/1445625964" art="/library/metadata/62076/art/1445625958" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62076/thumb/1445625958" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438448410" updatedAt="1445625964">

Recorded entirely on the band&apos;s dime before they had a new record deal, Bleed American features compelling lyrics, driving guitar work, and insanely catchy melodies. Left to their own devices during the recording process, it wouldn&apos;t have been surprising if the band had turned out another layered, sprawling album akin to their previous full-length masterwork, Clarity. Perhaps sensing that they wouldn&apos;t be able to top their previous work when it came to spacy emo, Bleed American heads in a new direction. There are no 16-minute songs here, just straight-ahead rock &amp; roll, performed with punk energy and alt-rock smarts. The title track sets the tone for the album with its blistering guitar attack and aggressive vocals. &quot;A Praise Chorus&quot; and &quot;The Middle improve upon that formula, maintaining the forceful instrumentation but toying with the lyrical themes. &quot;A Praise Chorus&quot; uses the most basic of rock emotions for lyrical inspiration, &quot;I wanna fall in love tonight,&quot; while lifting lyrics from Tommy James&apos; &quot;Crimson and Clover,&quot; They Might Be Giants&apos; &quot;Don&apos;t Let&apos;s Start,&quot; and Mötley Crüe&apos;s &quot;Kick Start My Heart,&quot; among others. When used in a song about the comfort and trappings of nostalgia, this borrowing comes off more like a well-placed tribute than stealing. &quot;The Middle&quot; offers a pep talk about self-acceptance and fitting in, and one of the most memorable guitar riffs this side of Angus Young. Bleed American&apos;s quieter moments recall some of the band&apos;s signature instrumentation from their previous work. Gentle keyboards, bells, and stirring background vocals from former that dog. member Rachel Haden enhance the understated beauty of ballads like &quot;Hear You Me&quot; and &quot;Cautioneers.&quot; Haden&apos;s most enjoyable contribution, however, is to the up-tempo rocker &quot;The Authority Song.&quot; On the surface a song about a song (John Mellencamp&apos;s &quot;Authority Song), it also name drops the Beatles&apos; &quot;What Goes On.&quot; The numerous references to other bands and other songs reveal that although Jimmy Eat World is a critically acclaimed and incredibly talented band, the members are really just rock fans themselves. If they maintain this level of quality, however, don&apos;t be surprised if the next generation of ambitious rockers start writing songs that pay tribute to Jimmy Eat World.

Things heated up for Ireland&apos;s much hyped &quot;new hope,&quot; what with 2000&apos;s endless excitable press clippings, triumphant festival slots, and a full-length chance to prove to the world if their three-minute slices of searing guitar distress were worth any of the attention in the first place. Indeed, fortune has been strong with this young trio. The fact that JJ72 sound completely unfazed even when they screw it all up is what makes this roaringly ambitious debut so captivating. &#xD;&#xA;It&apos;s an idea that has many a Suede and Joy Division name-checks sound apt, as proved by the likes of &quot;Snow&quot; or &quot;Algeria,&quot; sweltering, emotive crackles of indie guitar thunder that succeed in being as innocent and powerful as any song influenced by the greats. Truly, the magnificence of JJ72 is that they&apos;re on top form even when they don&apos;t seem to know what they&apos;re doing. Mark Greaney&apos;s garrulous growls and falsettos soar over far too many syllables. The band&apos;s &quot;soft/loud&quot; Nirvana-isms are occasionally banal. Sometimes it&apos;s only the band&apos;s wide-eyed eagerness that saves everything. With a lyrical mash-up of abstract imagery (&quot;Short sleeves and warm skin/losing coins calling next of kin&quot;) and glorious bursts of confessional euphoria -- somewhere in between the Sex Pistols and the poems of John Keats -- album peaks like &quot;Oxygen&quot; are extraordinary. They show how choosing the right blunders can make all the difference in the world. Because for all its evident talent, this debut album is admittedly a student film, with all of its naivete, vigor, and self-indulgence. These mistakes are big. These mistakes are personal.

The band doesn&apos;t simply revive the swirling guitar and organ riffs of psychedelia, they embrace the mysticism and Eastern spirtuality that informed the music. On both &quot;Tattva&quot; and &quot;Govinda,&quot; alead singer Crispian Mills has adapted portions of Sanskrit text for the lyrics, chanting Indian mantras without a hint of embarrassment. Similarly, Kula Shaker is unashamed about their devotion to Hendrix, Traffic and the Beatles, cutting their traditionalist tendencies with an onslaught of volume, overdriven guitars and catchy melodies -- though they have a song called &quot;Grateful When You&apos;re Dead,&quot; all of their psychedelic sensibilities derive from British rock, not the more experimental American counterpart. Kula Shaker may play well -- they have a powerful rush that makes you temporarily forget how classicist their music actually is -- but they still have trouble coming up with hooks. About half the record (&quot;Hey Dude,&quot; &quot;Tattva,&quot; &quot;Govinda,&quot; &quot;Grateful When You&apos;re Dead&quot;) have strong melodies hooks, while the rest just rides by on the band&apos;s instrumental skills.

Like In Rainbows before it, the actuality of The King of Limbs is purposefully somewhat obscured by the hullabaloo surrounding the album&apos;s surprise release -- announced for a Saturday release on a Monday, shifted to a Friday -- and in the case of KOL, such clamor is needed. Wispy and ephemeral, shimmering skin draped over the barest of bones, The King of Limbs doesn’t deliberately lack a solid foundation, songwriting traded for sound construction. Masters of mood that they are, Radiohead digitally weave stuttering, glitchy loops of drums and guitars with real instruments, Thom Yorke’s mournful moan and keening falsetto acting as a binding agent, creating an alluringly dour atmosphere. Despite a pair of intellectually funky moments -- “Morning Mr. Magpie” and “Little by Little,” grouped together at the beginning, giving the album a slight hint of momentum that quickly fades -- this is rather monochromatic and not too far removed from the territory Radiohead began etching out with Kid A. Where that icy 2000 effort had the bracing chill of the new, The King of Limbs is familiar -- not commonplace, but carrying a certain inevitability as its eight songs slowly unspool. There are no surprises in the floating textures, no delight in the details, no astonishment in how the band navigates intricate turns: this is the sound of Radiohead doing what they do, doing it very well, doing it without flash or pretension, gently easing from the role of pioneers to craftsmen. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2011" thumb="/library/metadata/60098/thumb/1445625294" art="/library/metadata/59975/art/1445625076" parentThumb="/library/metadata/59975/thumb/1445625076" originallyAvailableAt="2011-01-01" leafCount="8" addedAt="1438447860" updatedAt="1445625294">

Not afraid to plunder both her cool and distinctly uncool record collection, Ladyhawke, aka Pip Brown, has crafted 13 instantly accessible songs, each of which sounds like a potential hit single. Heavily influenced by synth pop, new wave, and AOR in equal measures, Ladyhawke, sounds like a who&apos;s who of &apos;80s pop. &quot;Back of the Van&quot; is the Pretenders meets Van Halen&apos;s &quot;Jump&quot;; &quot;Professional Suicide&quot; sounds like a lost classic Gary Numan single; while the storming chorus of &quot;My Delirium&quot; echoes the power pop of the Bangles and the Go Go&apos;s.

Lateralus demands close listening from the first piece onward, as it becomes quickly apparent that this is not going to be an album one can listen to and accept at face value. Complex rhythm changes, haunting vocals, and an onslaught of changes in dynamics make this an album other so-called metal groups could learn from.

Taking the heavy, distorted electric blues of Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, and Cream to an extreme, Zeppelin created a majestic, powerful brand of guitar rock constructed around simple, memorable riffs and lumbering rhythms. But the key to the group&apos;s attack was subtlety: it wasn&apos;t just an onslaught of guitar noise, it was shaded and textured, filled with alternating dynamics and tempos. As Led Zeppelin proves, the group was capable of such multi-layered music from the start. Although the extended psychedelic blues of &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; &quot;You Shook Me,&quot; and &quot;I Can&apos;t Quit You Baby&quot; often gather the most attention, the remainder of the album is a better indication of what would come later. &quot;Babe I&apos;m Gonna Leave You&quot; shifts from folky verses to pummeling choruses; &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot; and &quot;How Many More Times&quot; have groovy, bluesy shuffles; &quot;Your Time Is Gonna Come&quot; is an anthemic hard rocker; &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot; is pure English folk; and &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; is a frenzied rocker with a nearly punkish attack.

Since the group could only enter the studio for brief amounts of time, most of the songs that compose II are reworked blues and rock &amp; roll standards that the band was performing on-stage at the time. Not only did the short amount of time result in a lack of original material, it made the sound more direct. Jimmy Page still provided layers of guitar overdubs, but the overall sound of the album is heavy and hard, brutal and direct. &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; &quot;The Lemon Song,&quot; and &quot;Bring It on Home&quot; are all based on classic blues songs -- only, the riffs are simpler and louder and each song has an extended section for instrumental solos. Of the remaining six songs, two sport light acoustic touches (&quot;Thank You,&quot; &quot;Ramble On&quot;), but the other four are straight-ahead heavy rock that follows the formula of the revamped blues songs. While Led Zeppelin II doesn&apos;t have the eclecticism of the group&apos;s debut, it&apos;s arguably more influential.

The bonus disc on Led Zeppelin II does contain an entirely unheard song: the organ-led instrumental &quot;La La,&quot; which is notably different than anything else Zeppelin ever did. Its chipper organ refrain by John Paul Jones feels nearly sugary, a mood that&apos;s broken when Page comes crashing in with acoustics and trebly guitar overdubs. &quot;La La&quot; simultaneously looks back and forward, evoking some of the Yardbirds&apos; Little Games, even a bit of &quot;Beck&apos;s Bolero,&quot; throwbacks to be certain but its mini-suite construction suggests the more ambitious territory the band would soon explore. Elsewhere, Zeppelin are looking neither to the past or future; they&apos;re simply living in the present, a reflection of how Led Zeppelin II was recorded on the road. As a finished album, this quickness lent a vitality to the heavy blues and rock but the outtakes on the bonus disc don&apos;t pack many major revelations and, as such, it pales slightly to the companion supplemental material on Led Zeppelin and Led Zeppelin III. Nevertheless, this is worthwhile for serious Zepheads. There are notable difference here and there -- &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; feels different, with its midsection freakout tamed and Robert Plant&apos;s vocals somewhat restrained; it&apos;s also interesting to hear &quot;Moby Dick&quot; presented as just a set-up riff and conclusion, lacking John Bonham&apos;s solo -- but the lasting impression of these rough mixes and backing tracks is how much Page added in his final production. &quot;Ramble On,&quot; in particular, shows how Page&apos;s expert overdubs expanded the emotional template of a song and the contrast is fascinating, as is hearing the basic backing track of &quot;Living Loving Maid.&quot; Stripped of Plant&apos;s vocals and all of Page&apos;s guitar coloring, including solos, it&apos;s possible to focus on the essential groove of Page, Jones, and Bonham, which is something of a wonder to behold.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1969" thumb="/library/metadata/64941/thumb/1445627609" art="/library/metadata/64885/art/1445627605" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64885/thumb/1445627605" originallyAvailableAt="1969-01-01" leafCount="9" addedAt="1438447156" updatedAt="1445627609">

While there are still a handful of metallic rockers, III is built on a folky, acoustic foundation that gives the music extra depth. And even the rockers aren&apos;t as straightforward as before: the galloping &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; is powered by Robert Plant&apos;s banshee wail, &quot;Celebration Day&quot; turns blues-rock inside out with a warped slide guitar riff, and &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; lumbers along with a tricky, multi-part riff. Nevertheless, the heart of the album lies on the second side, when the band delve deeply into English folk. &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; updates a traditional tune with a menacing flair, and &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot; is an infectious acoustic romp, while &quot;That&apos;s the Way&quot; and &quot;Tangerine&quot; are shimmering songs with graceful country flourishes. The band hasn&apos;t left the blues behind, but the twisted bottleneck blues of &quot;Hats off to (Roy) Harper&quot; actually outstrips the epic &quot;Since I&apos;ve Been Loving You,&quot; which is the only time Zeppelin sound a bit set in their ways.

Expanding on the breakthroughs of III, Zeppelin fuse their majestic hard rock with a mystical, rural English folk that gives the record an epic scope. Even at its most basic -- the muscular, traditionalist &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; -- the album has a grand sense of drama, which is only deepened by Robert Plant&apos;s burgeoning obsession with mythology, religion, and the occult. Plant&apos;s mysticism comes to a head on the eerie folk ballad &quot;The Battle of Evermore,&quot; a mandolin-driven song with haunting vocals from Sandy Denny, and on the epic &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; Of all of Zeppelin&apos;s songs, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is the most famous, and not unjustly. Building from a simple fingerpicked acoustic guitar to a storming torrent of guitar riffs and solos, it encapsulates the entire album in one song. Which, of course, isn&apos;t discounting the rest of the album. &quot;Going to California&quot; is the group&apos;s best folk song, and the rockers are endlessly inventive, whether it&apos;s the complex, multi-layered &quot;Black Dog,&quot; the pounding hippie satire &quot;Misty Mountain Hop,&quot; or the funky riffs of &quot;Four Sticks.&quot; But the closer, &quot;When the Levee Breaks,&quot; is the one song truly equal to &quot;Stairway,&quot; helping give IV the feeling of an epic. An apocalyptic slice of urban blues, &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; is as forceful and frightening as Zeppelin ever got, and its seismic rhythms and layered dynamics illustrate why none of their imitators could ever equal them. &#xD;&#xA;[Led Zeppelin launched a massive, Jimmy Page-supervised reissue campaign in 2014, where each of their studio albums was remastered and then expanded with a bonus disc of alternate versions (in the case of the super deluxe editions, they were also supplemented by vinyl pressings and a massive hardcover book). The supplemental disc for Led Zeppelin IV is constructed as a mirror image of the finished album, comprised almost entirely of alternate mixes and instrumentals. &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; and &quot;Going to California&quot; belong to the latter category, consisting of nothing but the acoustic guitar and mandolin parts from the finished track, while the rest of the record is devoted to alternate mixes from various sources. Occasionally, a distinction leaps out -- there&apos;s a notable lack of swampy, cavernous echo on &quot;When the Levee Breaks,&quot; perhaps a few more keyboards on the midsection of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; -- but generally these mixes are leaner, tighter, and not all that different from the finished version. A song or two feels slightly different -- &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; jumps a bit as it seems to groove a little bit harder -- but by and large this disc shows that as a producer, Page not only knew where he wanted to go but he knew how to get it right the first time.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1971" thumb="/library/metadata/64920/thumb/1445628570" art="/library/metadata/64885/art/1445627605" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64885/thumb/1445627605" originallyAvailableAt="1971-01-01" leafCount="8" addedAt="1438447186" updatedAt="1445628570">

Not that Gutterflower sounded bleak -- it was clean and glossy, so much so that it would be easy to listen to it once and assume that there wasn&apos;t much there. Such assumptions also come to mind after the first listen for 2006&apos;s Let Love In, but unlike its predecessor, there isn&apos;t much to dig into here; what you hear upon that first listen is exactly what you get. And this is a record that has very little connection to the ramshackle rock band the Goo Goo Dolls were at the beginning of their career, and there&apos;s also only a thin thread connecting this to even their commercial breakthrough of A Boy Named Goo in the alt-rock salad days of 1995. Thanks in no small part to their new producer, Glen Ballard -- who made his name as the man behind Alanis Morissette&apos;s Jagged Little Pill and then went on to sand down the rough edges of Aerosmith, Live, and the Dave Matthews Band, and performs the same task here -- this is the sound of a mainstream adult rock band, a band that knows their craft and does little to push the boundaries of that craft. Certainly, they do little to break convention here, either, relying on ballads and mid-tempo tunes that feel like ballads for the bulk of the record -- and when they do decide to rock (usually on a Robby Takac number), it&apos;s almost as if they made a conscious effort to turn the volume down on their amps before they started to play. It&apos;s easy listening music for a generation raised on rock, but that&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing. Frontman Johnny Rzeznik remains a solid journeyman rocker, as both a writer and singer, and he crafts songs that are likeable and sturdier than those of such peers as Rob Thomas, even if his tunes aren&apos;t all that memorable this time around, particularly when they&apos;re dressed in an immaculate production like this, where every track is produced so smoothly it all blends together. But even that certain element of repetition makes Let Love In work as pleasant background music -- which may sound like damning with faint praise, particularly since there would have been a time when the Goo Goo Dolls would never have thought of themselves as being merely pleasant, but it just means the album works on its own (albeit limited and modest) terms.

The album was constructed as a blockbuster, featuring Dion&apos;s trademark melodramatic ballads, some carefully tailored dance-pop, a bevy of duets with the likes of Barbra Streisand and the Bee Gees, and production and songs from adult contemporary gurus David Foster, Jim Steinman, and Walter Afanasieff. Given that so many talented craftsmen worked on Let&apos;s Talk About Love, it makes sense that a number of the cuts succeed according to adult contemporary terms -- they are predictably sweeping showcases for Dion&apos;s soaring, technically skilled voice. As usual, the singles (including the Streisand duet &quot;Tell Him&quot; and the Titanic love theme &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;) shine the most brilliantly, but even the filler is immaculately produced. If the end result doesn&apos;t quite gel as an album, that shouldn&apos;t be surprising -- this is music by committee, a product that was made to appeal to the widest possible audience. Such a calculated execution guarantees that anyone who liked one of the singles shouldn&apos;t be disappointed by Let&apos;s Talk About, but it doesn&apos;t necessarily mean they&apos;ll remember all of the record after it&apos;s finished playing.

Here, on their eponymous third album, Lifehouse is a rock band that doesn&apos;t rock. They strum acoustic guitars and sing earnest mid-tempo anthems and ballads, all given a slick shine by producer John Alagia, who has previously worked on records by the Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer, and Jason Mraz -- a collaborator whose very presence indicates how far the group has shifted from its early Brendan O&apos;Brien productions. While some longtime fans will miss the band&apos;s harder side, Lifehouse sound, well, more comfortable in this setting, and they&apos;ve made an album that&apos;s smooth, mellow, reasonably tuneful, inoffensive, and thoroughly unmemorable. It&apos;s not an album that makes waves, it&apos;s a record that&apos;s designed to ease onto the AAA radio waves, where it will politely sit next to songs by Matthews, Mayer, and Mraz. And on that level, Lifehouse is indeed a success, since it&apos;s pleasant enough as it&apos;s playing, but the drawback is that it could too easily be mistaken as the work of many other bands who mine the same territory.

This magnificent two-disc compilation features 56 of these tracks, including 29 covers of early rock, R&amp;B, soul, and pop tunes that never appeared on their official releases, as well as the Lennon-McCartney original &quot;I&apos;ll Be on My Way,&quot; which they gave in 1963 to Billy J. Kramer rather than record it themselves. These performances are nothing less than electrifying, especially the previously unavailable covers, which feature quite a few versions of classics by Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins, and Elvis Presley. There are also off-the-beaten-path tunes by the Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly on down to obscurities by the Jodimars, Chan Romero (a marvelous &quot;Hippy Hippy Shake&quot;), Eddie Fontaine, and Ann-Margret. The greatest gem is probably their fabulous version of Arthur Alexander&apos;s &quot;Soldier of Love,&quot; which (like several of the tracks) would have easily qualified as a highlight of their early releases if they had issued it officially. Restored from existing tapes of various quality, the sound is mostly very good and never less than listenable. Unfortunately, they weren&apos;t able to include every single rarity that the Beatles recorded for the BBC; the absence of Carl Perkins&apos; &quot;Lend Me Your Comb,&quot; which has circulated on bootlegs in a high-fidelity version, is especially mystifying. Minor quibbles aside, these performances, available on bootlegs for years, compose the major missing chapter in the Beatles&apos; legacy, and it&apos;s great to have them easily obtainable in a first-rate package.

That all changed in 2001, and Coil released a series of four concert recordings, documenting the evolution of the live Coil experience. Live Four, recorded in Prague and Vienna in 2002, features the best sound quality of the series, and a compelling performance from John Balance, Peter Christopherson, Thighpaulsandra, and Ossian Brown, also known as Ossian Sex Shop. The album begins with a one-two punch: the incantatory &quot;I Am Angie Bowie (Sine Waves)&quot; leading into &quot;Last Rites of Spring,&quot; which is filled with creepy synths, lurching and glowering like a malevolent spirit finally made flesh. The piece rotates around itself, never really seeming to progress, but constantly is turning in on itself. &quot;Are You Shivering?&quot; continues the creepy synth vibe, descending violins or hurdy-gurdies channeling the spirit of Norma Desmond at the end of Sunset Boulevard. The highlight of the concert is &quot;Amethyst Deceivers.&quot; It has a spacy atmosphere, all bouncing-ball bass and tinkling piano. Ossian&apos;s hurdy-gurdy also plays in well on the track, directly leading to the climax of the piece.

This album is a highlight not only of the Live series, but also of the Coil catalog. ~ James Mason" index="1" year="2003" thumb="/library/metadata/66405/thumb/1445628811" art="/library/metadata/61395/art/1445625678" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" originallyAvailableAt="2003-01-01" leafCount="10" addedAt="1438445631" updatedAt="1445628811">

By all accounts of the time it was a truly awesome multimedia spectacle. But there are strange and sad ironies that accompany this release as well. For starters, it was released in the U.K. exactly a week after the death of Richard Wright, Gilmour&apos;s longtime bandmate in Pink Floyd, and his keyboardist here. Secondly, it appears during a period of increased tension between Russia and the United States over the latter&apos;s proposed missile defense system to be placed in Poland (by the U.S.) and the country&apos;s intended membership in NATO. But there is nothing bittersweet about the music to be found on this double-disc package (one of six different packages that document the event and the tour -- apparently nobody told Gilmour the recording industry was in an economic crisis). On this version, two and a half hours document the entire concert. Gilmour&apos;s band -- Wright, Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera, keyboardist Jon Carin, bassist Guy Pratt, drummer Steve DiStanislao, and saxophonist Dick Parry -- is accompanied by the Baltic Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, including its 40-piece string section, conducted by Zbigniew Preisner (who did the arrangements on Gilmour&apos;s On an Island album). &#xD;&#xA;While cynics can debate the pretentious of this date forever, everyone else can enjoy an utterly engaging, entertaining, and sometimes emotionally moving performance of Gilmour&apos;s entire On an Island album and a boxful of Pink Floyd hits to boot. The first disc begins with Floyd&apos;s Dark Side of the Moon suite of &quot;Speak to Me,&quot; &quot;Breathe,&quot; and &quot;Time,&quot; and comes to a close with the reprise of the opening track. With the orchestra accompanying the band, the dreaminess and spaciness of the original music miraculously comes through, and Gilmour is in fine voice as well. The rest of disc one is taken up by an almost totally in-sequence performance of On an Island. The live version of the album rocks more, perhaps because of the steady presence of Manzanera, who adds extra punch to Gilmour&apos;s airy bluesy one on guitar. This is especially true on &quot;Take a Breath,&quot; when his crunchy, crackling power chords come off like something from his own Diamond Head album; his solo against the counterpoint of the orchestra makes it one of the set&apos;s true rockist highlights. Disc two is comprised entirely of performances of Pink Floyd tunes from albums as diverse as Atom Heart Mother (&quot;Fat Old Sun&quot;), Wish You Were Here (&quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; and its title track), The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (&quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;), Meddle (&quot;Echoes&quot;), The Wall(&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;), and The Division Bell (&quot;A Great Day for Freedom&quot;). The performances are not terribly spontaneous in part because of the orchestral arrangements, but they are flawless (again, Manzanera&apos;s presence adds some real muscle) and, given the sheer quality of the sound, they have plenty of presence and warmth despite being recorded in front of a concert audience. This set may be strictly for Gilmour and Pink Floyd fans, but as such, for all its packaging pomp (it&apos;s green though: carbon-neutral cardboard wallets for all the different packages), it feels like something historic and beautifully considered as well as executed. It would have been amazing to be in that audience.

Make of it what you will, but it is compelling stuff. Coil resurrect &quot;Blood From the Air,&quot; which dates back to Horse Rotorvator, in a new, almost lounge version.

During the new millennium the door remained open for other female singer/songwriters, including Emiliana Torrini. Torrini&apos;s beautiful vocals match the translucence of Beth Orton and Kate Bush and the undying passion of Björk. Her debut Love in the Time of Science is a shimmering delight of gossamer lyrics and swooning instrumental imagery. Tears for Fears&apos; Roland Orzabal assists with production and songwriting, enabling Torrini&apos;s voice to soar over intricate basslines and synth programming. In addition to her dramatic roar, Torrini brings a subtle hush to her songs as well. &quot;Tuna Fish&quot; and &quot;Dead Things&quot; are deep reflections of emotional pain and social frustration. Elsewhere, the album further explores the creative core of this artist who&apos;s aching for an answer, begging for an explanation through song. But Torrini isn&apos;t entirely absorbed by heavy moods. She&apos;s refreshing on the cathartic &quot;Unemployed in Summertime,&quot; a breezy seascape of jazzy bass loops and delicate string arrangements. &quot;Telepathy&quot; is the album&apos;s zenith and swan song -- full of crashing horns and percussion clamoring with Torrini&apos;s vibrance.

The 25-song set covers just about the entire heyday of the band, from their first single (&quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;) to their last (&quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;). No doubt it&apos;s a remarkable journey, indelible proof that John Lennon and Paul McCartney -- and, with &quot;Something,&quot; George Harrison -- wrote love songs that were built to last, transcending their era. However, grouping them one after another was not a good idea. The Beatles were about balance, about the four personalities interacting, editing and enhancing each other -- and their music reflected that balance even as it grew wilder and more eclectic. This package tilts the balance much too heavily in one direction, and it gives the illusion of making even this endlessly inventive band sound like something that it was not: sentimental, predictable. The whole thing came in a double-pocket, brown imitation-leather sleeve with gold lettering, with a 28-page booket of lyrics and a double-fold Richard Avedon photo of the Fab Four -- a package aimed all-too precisely at holiday impulse-buying traffic.

While the comparisons were apt at the time, &quot;Kiss with a Fist&quot; turned out to be a red herring in the wake of the release of Lungs, one of the most musically mature and emotionally mesmerizing albums of 2009. With an arsenal of weaponry that included the daring musicality of Kate Bush, the fearless delivery of Sinéad O&apos;Connor, and the dark, unhinged vulnerability of Fiona Apple, the London native crafted a debut that not only lived up to the machine-gun spray of buzz that heralded her arrival, but easily surpassed it. Like Kate Bush, Welch has little interest (for the most part) in traditional pop structures, and her songs are at their best when they see something sparkle in the woods and veer off of the main trail in pursuit. &quot;Kiss with a Fist,&quot; as good as it is, pales in comparison to standout cuts like &quot;Dog Days Are Over,&quot; &quot;Hurricane Drunk,&quot; &quot;Drumming Song,&quot; &quot;Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Love,&quot; all of which are anchored to the earth by Welch&apos;s knockout voice, a truly impressive and intuitive trio of producers, and a backing band that sounds as intimate with the material as its creator.

Listeners turned off by the image may as well give up right there, as the remaining tracks on Magpie expound on the mellow ache of heartbreak and self-doubt with nary a crack in the sun to be had. Fretwell&apos;s soft and breathy delivery is reminiscent of Wilco&apos;s Jeff Tweedy or a less brooding Leonard Cohen, and his soft, sparse arrangements help set the mood for the kind of melancholy that feels good. Even the more fleshed-out tracks like &quot;Run&quot; and &quot;Lines&quot; sound as if they were made by the artist alone in an abandoned barn by the seaside, and it&apos;s a testament to his misery that they when the chords shift into major the songs lose nothing of their self-imposed isolation.

The hugely experimental follow-up to 2006&apos;s Like Drawing Blood doesn&apos;t discriminate against other decades, as evident on the impossibly uplifting &apos;60s retro soul of &quot;I Feel Better,&quot; the &apos;70s West Coast harmonies of the ethereal lullaby-like closer &quot;Bronte,&quot; the &apos;90s Beck-esque scuzzy garage rock of &quot;Easy Way Out,&quot; and the 2000s hushed, claustrophobic dubstep of &quot;Don&apos;t Worry, We&apos;ll Be Watching You.&quot; But seemingly unaffected by the constant comparisons with the likes of Sting and Peter Gabriel, it&apos;s the era of early new wave, dub, and worldbeat which defines its 12 tracks. Unexpected chart-topper &quot;Somebody That I Used to Know,&quot; a collaboration with New Zealand vocalist Kimbra, is an oddball break-up song whose stuttering rhythms, reggae hooks, and hushed vocals sound like the Police as remixed by the XX, &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot; echoes the avant-garde pop of Gabriel&apos;s So, with its pounding tribal drums, orchestral flourishes, and new age melodies, while there are also nods to George Michael&apos;s &quot;Faith&quot; on the acoustic gospel-pop of &quot;In Your Light&quot;; the impassioned Aussie rock of Midnight Oil on the ecologically themed &quot;Eyes Wide Open,&quot; and electro pioneer Thomas Dolby on the strange, vocodered vocals, spoken word samples, and skank guitars of the trippy &quot;State of the Art.&quot; Familiar they may be, but some credit has to go to De Backer for managing to weave these eclectic retro sounds into a cohesive affair, which proves that along with recent efforts by Art vs. Science and Architecture in Helsinki, Australia is fast becoming one of the biggest purveyors of quality experimental pop. ~ Jon O&apos;Brien" index="1" year="2012" thumb="/library/metadata/65233/thumb/1445628708" art="/library/metadata/65232/art/1445627903" parentThumb="/library/metadata/65232/thumb/1445627903" originallyAvailableAt="2012-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438446884" updatedAt="1445628708">

(UK)" type="album" title="Man On The Roof" parentKey="/library/metadata/59791" parentTitle="Stephen Fretwell" summary="Stephen Fretwell&apos;s 2007 album Man on the Roof sees the English singer/songwriter combining the earthy delivery of a Devils &amp; Dust-era Bruce Springsteen with the gentle warmth, intimacy, and haunting nature of Jeff Buckley. It seems an impossible combination -- or at least an improbable one -- and hearing Fretwell pull it off with casual ease is enough to give any music fan pause. While still in his 20s during the writing and recording of this album, there is a weariness in Fretwell&apos;s voice on Man on the Roof that makes him sound older and wiser than his years, something that is both surprising and endearing. His music possesses a yearning, searching quality here, but it seems that Fretwell is less concerned than his musical contemporaries about finding his place in the world. Instead, he seems to be more dedicated to experiencing and enjoying life&apos;s journey; he possesses a sense of contentment that separates him from more restless singer/songwriters. The Fretwell captured on Man on the Roof is a hopeful dreamer, not a wistful one. There is one notable exception to Fretwell&apos;s happy seeker persona here: the ethereal, borderline transcendence of &quot;The Scheme.&quot; One of the most austere tracks on the album (along with the gritty &quot;Saturday&quot;), &quot;The Scheme&quot; is dominated by a powerful, soulful agony that is at once wrenching and intoxicating. It is here that Fretwell most closely resembles Buckley, nearly reaching the same musical heights and revealing just how well he has perfected his craft. Even in songs that deal with heartache and fading love, Fretwell still reaches for a light in the darkness -- or barring that, makes his own. ~ Katherine Fulton" index="1" year="2007" thumb="/library/metadata/59792/thumb/1445625116" parentThumb="/library/metadata/59791/thumb/1445624977" originallyAvailableAt="2007-01-01" leafCount="14" addedAt="1438447082" updatedAt="1445625116">

Of course, neither sentiment is true. Much of the music on Maxinquaye has its roots in the trip-hop pioneered by Massive Attack, which once featured Tricky, and after the success of this record, trip-hop became fashionable, turning into safe, comfortable music to be played at upscale dinner parties thrown by hip twenty and thirtysomethings. Both of these sentiments are true, yet Maxinquaye still manages to retain its power; years later, it can still sound haunting, disturbing, and surprising after countless spins. It&apos;s an album that exists outside of time and outside of trends, a record whose clanking rhythms, tape haze, murmured vocals, shards of noise, reversed gender roles, alt-rock asides, and soul samplings create a ghostly netherworld fused with seductive menace and paranoia. It also shimmers with mystery, coming not just from Tricky -- whose voice isn&apos;t even heard until the second song on the record -- but his vocalist, Martine, whose smoky singing lures listeners into the unrelenting darkness of the record. Once they&apos;re there, Maxinquaye offers untold treasures. There is the sheer pleasure of coasting by on the sound of the record, how it makes greater use of noise and experimental music than anything since the Bomb Squad and Public Enemy. Then, there&apos;s the tip of the hat to PE with a surreal cover of &quot;Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos,&quot; sung by Martine and never sounding like a postmodernist in-joke. Other references and samples register subconsciously -- while Isaac Hayes&apos; &quot;Ike&apos;s Rap II&quot; flows through &quot;Hell Is Around the Corner&quot; and the Smashing Pumpkins are even referenced in the title of &quot;Pumpkin,&quot; Shakespear&apos;s Sister and the Chantels slip by, while Michael Jackson&apos;s &quot;Bad&quot; thrillingly bleeds into &quot;Expressway to Your Heart&quot; on &quot;Brand New You&apos;re Retro.&quot; Lyrics flow in and out of consciousness, with lingering, whispered promises suddenly undercut by veiled threats and bursts of violence. Then, there&apos;s how music that initially may seem like mood pieces slowly reveal their ingenious structure and arrangement and register as full-blown songs, or how the alternately languid and chaotic rhythms finally compliment each other, turning this into a bracing sonic adventure that gains richness and resonance with each listen. After all, there&apos;s so much going on here -- within the production, the songs, the words -- it remains fascinating even after all of its many paths have been explored (which certainly can&apos;t be said of the trip-hop that followed, including records by Tricky). And that air of mystery that can be impenetrable upon the first listen certainly is something that keeps Maxinquaye tantalizing after it&apos;s become familiar, particularly because, like all good mysteries, there&apos;s no getting to the bottom of it, no matter how hard you try. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1995" thumb="/library/metadata/61587/thumb/1445626221" art="/library/metadata/61586/art/1445625780" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61586/thumb/1445625780" originallyAvailableAt="1995-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438448598" updatedAt="1445626221">

With Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, the band turns in one of the most ambitious and indulgent albums in rock history. Lasting over two hours and featuring 28 songs, the album is certainly a challenging listen. To Billy Corgan&apos;s credit, it&apos;s a rewarding and compelling one as well. Although the artistic scope of the album is immense, the Smashing Pumpkins flourish in such an overblown setting. Corgan&apos;s songwriting has never been limited by conventional notions of what a rock band can do, even if it is clear that he draws inspiration from scores of &apos;70s heavy metal and art rock bands. Instead of copying the sounds of his favorite records, he expands on their ideas, making the gentle piano of the title track and the sighing &quot;1979&quot; sit comfortably against the volcanic rush of &quot;Jellybelly&quot; and &quot;Zero.&quot; In between those two extremes lies an array of musical styles, drawing from rock, pop, folk, and classical. Some of the songs don&apos;t work as well as others, but Mellon Collie never seems to drag.

David Gilmour" summary="Early in their career, the Orb were accused (but never proven) of creating a series of trance mixes of Pink Floyd albums, and the group had plenty of other Floydian references too -- most obviously, the Battersea Power Station appeared or was parodied on several of their releases. The connection only became direct, though, in 2009, when David Gilmour recorded a version of the Graham Nash single &quot;Chicago&quot; with help from producer Youth, an occasional member of the Orb going back to the early &apos;90s. It was a charity single to aid accused hacker Gary McKinnon, but it became the springboard for further collaboration one year later, after Orb main man Dr. Alex Paterson became involved. Metallic Spheres is the result, a 49-minute odyssey that is very intentionally split up into only two tracks. The Orb fans and Pink Floyd fans should have no trouble with this album. In fact, Orb fans will find more resemblance to their classic early-&apos;90s sound than ever; that is, less dense soundworlds and more skeletal groove-riding over a lazy 4/4 beat. Meanwhile, Pink Floyd fans looking for the imprint of the master will find them everywhere -- Gilmour&apos;s guitar or lap steel, and rarely, his vocals (sampled from &quot;Chicago&quot;) feature all over this record, mostly reminiscent of either the countrified haze originally heard on Meddle or the, well, spacy haze from The Dark Side of the Moon. The highlight comes 40-odd minutes into the record, when Youth takes up his mighty bass for &quot;Chicago Dub.&quot; Otherwise, the record simply rolls along with all the sublime calm of The Orb&apos;s Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld or the &quot;Echoes&quot; portion of Meddle. ~ John Bush" index="1" year="2010" thumb="/library/metadata/62171/thumb/1445626395" originallyAvailableAt="2010-01-01" leafCount="2" addedAt="1438448375" updatedAt="1445626395">

It&apos;s a play on his last name, which is appropriate, since it not only indicates how self-absorbed Mr. Mraz is, but it&apos;s a good match for the dirty joke title of his debut. That&apos;s because Jason Mraz is primarily concerned with two things: himself and sex.

In this song, Mr. A-Z himself claims that &quot;it&apos;s all about the wordplay&quot; because &quot;I am the wizard of oohs.&quot; Now if Mr. Wizard was really all about the wordplay -- that is, all about rhyming games and clever juxtapositions -- he would realize that his self-anointed title doesn&apos;t sound like &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (and no amount of musical quotations from the film&apos;s theme song will change that), it sounds like he&apos;s the &quot;wizard of ooze.&quot; That&apos;s a far cry from &quot;Till I step on the brakes to get out of her clutches,&quot; to randomly pick an example from Elvis Costello, a songwriter who truly does relish playing with words (and was more of an outsider than this self-proclaimed &quot;geek&quot;), but his awkward wordplay does fit, because Mraz does come across like the Wizard of Ooze. Even when he&apos;s trying to be romantic he inadvertently gets sleazy, whether it&apos;s on the mock-operatic crooning that closes &quot;Mr. Curiosity&quot; or how &quot;damn&quot; is softly cooed in the chorus of the absurd &quot;Plane,&quot; where he takes consolation that even if his flight crashes, he&apos;ll at least be able to see his lover&apos;s house from here. Not exactly romantic mood music, but Mraz prefers matters of the flesh anyway, rapidly spitting out lyrics about hooking up, such as &quot;I can taste you all over my face,&quot; that make Dave Matthews&apos;s &quot;hike up your skirt a little more&quot; seem classy. Of course, Mraz&apos;s loose-limbed, litely funky, litely jazzy pop recalls Matthews and all of the post-Aware Records singer/songwriters that followed in his wake, but Mraz stands apart from the pack in how he&apos;s absolutely smitten with his ability to make words come out of his mouth. He loves to have his words spiral up and down on a cascade of moon/June/spoon rhymes and repetition. He loves to have them spill out uncontrollably, cramming as many words into a phrase as possible, unless he&apos;s diving for that dirty joke, as he does on &quot;Geek in the Pink&quot; (which has a bad single entendre title in the first place), when he stretches out &quot;I can save you from unoriginal dum-dums/Who would care if you come...plete him or not&quot; -- a move that isn&apos;t nearly as funny as Tim Curry&apos;s Frank N Furter&apos;s prolonged delivery of &quot;anticipation&quot; in &quot;Sweet Transvestite,&quot; and not delivered with nearly as much lip-smacking zeal, either. That&apos;s because Mraz, ironically enough for a guy who specializes in music designed for college parties, doesn&apos;t have much of an inclusive vibe to his music; he&apos;s so into himself and what he can do that he doesn&apos;t bother to invite anybody else along for the ride. All of these traits were apparent on Waiting for My Rocket to Come, but with a little success underneath his belt, Mraz is content to indulge himself to his heart&apos;s content on Mr. A-Z, constructing songs that ride a groove with the sole purpose of giving himself a place to sing and kind of rap about the glories of himself, or to make juvenile jokes. For those who enjoyed the wise-ass undercurrent of his debut, this will be a delight. For those who enjoyed &quot;The Remedy (I Won&apos;t Worry),&quot; there will be too much narcissistic tomfoolery here to make this enjoyable. For those who never understood the appeal of Jason Mraz in the first place, Mr. A-Z will make them realize that they&apos;ve really been taking John Mayer for granted.

The group never really went away in the ensuing period, of course, but had maintained a cult status underground for the better part of the &apos;90s. The duo consistently produced stunning albums, but the recordings were often in scarce limited editions that usually reached only hardcore fans. The Musick to Play in the Dark CD and LP were available through mail order only, and featured the core duo of Peter Christopherson and John Balance joined by collaborator Thighpaulsandra. The CD is the first full-length album Coil released on its own Chalice label as a subscription only release. Later in 2000, the album was thankfully re-pressed by Word Serpent, assuring wider availability. The album is a masterpiece of the caliber of the classic &apos;80s trilogy Scatology, Horse Rotovator, and Loves Secret Domain, which gave Coil the highest stature in the post-industrial music scene as one of the most inventive, original, and courageous groups of the genre. Musick to Play in the Dark is an utterly mesmerizing work, and is nothing short of brilliant. The album&apos;s scope takes in the music of the &apos;90s, the bleak digital processing and glitch music (Oval, Coh, and Nurse With Wound all spring to mind), but here these often sterile sounds are married to a human warmth that is inimitable Coil -- a sound that carries through the group&apos;s career as one of the most distinctive in the post-industrial canon. Along with the essential Coil &apos;80s recordings, Musick to Play in the Dark cannot be recommended highly enough. It represents a chapter in British music that goes beyond the term industrial and into untapped realms of experimentation that place Coil, along with Current 93 and Nurse With Wound, among the &apos;90s British groups more deserving of attention than their obscurity may ever permit. ~ Skip Jansen" index="1" year="1999" thumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" art="/library/metadata/61395/art/1445625678" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" originallyAvailableAt="1999-01-01" leafCount="6" addedAt="1438445835" updatedAt="1445628743">

Unlike an awful pub rock mistake or a tuneless ambient workout, there seems to be nothing more obnoxious than listening to a record that tries -- and fails -- to be either funny or frightening. Coil&apos;s Musick to Play in the Dark 2 takes the latter stab into forbidding, blood-velvet territory and consistently bungles it up. &quot;Ether&quot; ends with a magnificently processed, sincerely unsettling chant, but it takes almost 11 minutes of &quot;cats + piano&quot; melodies to get there. Elsewhere, opener &quot;Something&quot; takes a deeply effective, goth Gaia heartbeat and polishes it with cartoonish &quot;menacing&quot; swooshes and sirens that probably could be found on a two-buck &quot;Boo! Halloween Hits!&quot; supermarket CD. The sincerity of Coil should not be undervalued -- as work here and in the past can easily attest to -- it&apos;s the failure to harmonize it with a minimalist instinct that gets in the way.

But Bruce Springsteen was the first person to act on that theory, when he opted to release the demo versions of his latest songs, recorded with only acoustic or electric guitar, harmonica, and vocals, as his sixth album, Nebraska. It was really the content that dictated the approach, however. Nebraska&apos;s ten songs marked a departure for Springsteen, even as they took him farther down a road he had been traveling previously. Gradually, his songs had become darker and more pessimistic, and those on Nebraska marked a new low. They also found him branching out into better developed stories. The title track was a first-person account of the killing spree of mass murderer Charlie Starkweather. (It can&apos;t have been coincidental that the same story was told in director Terrence Malick&apos;s 1973 film Badlands, also used as a Springsteen song title.) That song set the tone for a series of portraits of small-time criminals, desperate people, and those who loved them. Just as the recordings were unpolished, the songs themselves didn&apos;t seem quite finished; sometimes the same line turned up in two songs. But that only served to unify the album. Within the difficult times, however, there was hope, especially as the album went on. &quot;Open All Night&quot; was a Chuck Berry-style rocker, and the album closed with &quot;Reason to Believe,&quot; a song whose hard-luck verses were belied by the chorus -- even if the singer couldn&apos;t understand what it was, &quot;people find some reason to believe.&quot; Still, Nebraska was one of the most challenging albums ever released by a major star on a major record label.

More than ten years divide the demise of the original band from the release of Never Forget, a period during which many people have probably forgotten just how all-pervasive these songs once were. From the opening &quot;Promises&quot; in late 1991 to the farewell &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot; in 1996, Take That racked up 16 hits, including that remarkable run in 1993-1994 that saw them become the first band since the Beatles to score four consecutive British number ones. Twice! Add a live version of &quot;Pray&quot; (from 1994), a remix of &quot;Relight My Fire,&quot; and one previously unreleased number (the closing &quot;Today I&apos;ve Lost You&quot;), and the only serious problem here is the omission of the band&apos;s first-ever single, the non-charting &quot;Do What You Like.&quot; So much for the statistics. More intriguing is to actually listen to the music for the first time, again, in more than ten years -- and realize just what perfectly wrought, exquisitely manufactured fluff it was. The Bee Gees cover is superlative, the Lulu collaboration is a riot, and -- even at their sappiest -- Take That so readily eclipse every other boy band of the era (and there were a lot of them around in the 1990s) that it almost seems cruel to continue to refer to them as one. But they were and, for all their sins, a lot of &quot;serious&quot; music fans hated them for it.

During that extended break, they decided to not worry about their supposedly lost street credibility and make an album according to their instincts, which meant more experimentation and less of their trademark punk-pop. Of course, speedy, catchy punk is at the core of the group&apos;s sound, so there are plenty of familiar moments on the resultant album, Nimrod, but there are also new details that make the record an invigorating, if occasionally frustrating, listen. Although punk-pop is Green Day&apos;s forte, they sound the most alive on Nimrod when they&apos;re breaking away from their formula, whether it&apos;s the shuffling &quot;Hitchin&apos; a Ride,&quot; the bitchy, tongue-in-cheek humor of &quot;The Grouch,&quot; the surging surf instrumental &quot;Last Ride In,&quot; the punchy, horn-driven drag-queen saga &quot;King for a Day,&quot; or the acoustic, string-laced ballad &quot;Good Riddance.&quot; It&apos;s only when the trio confines itself to three chords that it sounds tired, but Billie Joe has such a gift for hooky, instantly memorable melodies that even these moments are enjoyable, if unremarkable. Still, Nimrod suffers from being simply too much -- although it clocks in at under 50 minutes, the 18 tracks whip by at such a breakneck speed that it leaves you somewhat dazed. With a little editing, Green Day&apos;s growth would have been put in sharper relief, and Nimrod would have been the triumphant leap forward it set out to be. As it stands, it&apos;s a muddled but intermittently exciting record that is full of promise.

The moody album contains pensive lyrics, soulfully sung by Jason Wade, which are supported by organic electric guitar arrangements. The simplified, but by no means simple, music aptly supports Wade&apos;s sonorous voice, which can be compared to Eddie Vedder, Scott Stapp of Creed, and Scott Weiland. At age 20, Wade, who takes songwriting credit, is a lyrical wunderkind, writing words generally reserved for his older counterparts. The album&apos;s theme is one of searching -- spiritually, personally, and emotionally -- and this is particularly in evidence on the tracks &quot;Unknown,&quot; &quot;Trying,&quot; and &quot;Only One.&quot; Lifehouse makes a refreshing departure from other post-grunge, youth-oriented bands, who, for example, sing of one-night-stands, big butts, and the ills of society. Here, Wade revels in humanity, exploring and questioning its every nook and cranny. No Name Face benefits from the seasoned ears of Brendan O&apos;Brien (Pearl Jam, U2, Stone Temple Pilots), who mixed the album, and producer Ron Aniello. Both brought Wade&apos;s vocals and lyrics to the forefront of the mix and, rather than overshadowing them with complex and overbearing instrumentation, kept the music appropriately in the background. It&apos;s an intelligent musical formula sorely missed in much music of the early 21st century, particularly in this type of music where songs are sometimes nothing more than a cacophony of screaming and effects-laden instrumentation. It really is a bit of a surprise to see such musical maturity hailing from such a young (in age and tenure) band. No Name Face should fit right in on rock radio.

This willfully ignored both the vital contribution Bonham gave to the group&apos;s mystique and Zeppelin&apos;s woeful one-off reunion at the 1985 Live Aid charity concert, but the legend of the band was so strong, reunion rumors reached a fever pitch whenever vocalist Robert Plant or guitarist Jimmy Page had a new album in the stores. In 1994, following Plant&apos;s moody, misunderstood 1993 album Fate of Nations and Page&apos;s widely lambasted collaboration with Whitesnake singer David Coverdale, the two quietly reunited to record a concert for MTV&apos;s then-popular acoustic concert series Unplugged. Page &amp; Plant interpreted the Unplugged moniker rather liberally, bringing in a full orchestra, mandolins, and a hurdy-gurdy among other instruments, and Page turned to an electric guitar on occasion. Nevertheless, the &quot;unplugged&quot; setting did give the duo an opportunity to gracefully back away from the bombast that was assumed to be Zeppelin&apos;s stock-in-trade; after all, it would have been very hard to do &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; or &quot;Trampled Underfoot&quot; in this setting. Instead, this gives them a chance to dive into the moodiest material, trading heavily on the folk, blues, and world music that gave Led Zeppelin a richness unheard in their heavy rock peers. This might not be what some diehards were expecting from a reunion, but it was a gutsy move from Page &amp; Plant, and the ensuing album, No Quarter, has aged remarkably well. That&apos;s not to say that it&apos;s timeless music, or a latter-day comeback on the level of Bob Dylan&apos;s Love and Theft, but this is ambitiously atmospheric, restless music by musicians not content to rest on their laurels. They do draw heavily from their past, but these new versions of classic Led Zeppelin songs sound reinvigorated in these new arrangements. At times, this means that the songs are given rather drastic reinterpretations -- &quot;Nobody&apos;s Fault but Mine&quot; brings the brooding undercurrent of the original to the surface, &quot;Four Sticks&quot; sounds livelier in this spare setting -- while other tunes sound similar to the recorded versions but are given spirited readings (&quot;That&apos;s the Way,&quot; &quot;The Battle of Evermore,&quot; &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;). Between these revived Zeppelin numbers are a few new songs, all ambitious and solid, fitting right into the vibe of the album; even if they don&apos;t match the older tunes, they&apos;re respectable and gain strength upon repeated listens. As good as much of No Quarter is, it isn&apos;t necessarily the kind of record that invites those repeated listens. At its core, it&apos;s an experiment, the sound of two middle-aged musicians looking back at their groundbreaking work and finding both sustenance and inspiration there. That makes for fascinating listening, both upon the first spin and a return play several years later, but it doesn&apos;t necessarily make for an album that&apos;s played all that often. [Upon its original 1994 release No Quarter contained 13 tracks. Several years later, it was reissued overseas, adding the previously unreleased original &quot;Wah Wah&quot; as a bonus track. Upon the album&apos;s tenth anniversary, it was reissued in the U.S. with &quot;Wah Wah,&quot; plus the previously unreleased &quot;The Rain Song,&quot; which took the place of &quot;Thank You,&quot; which was cut from the album on this reissue. Finally, the 2004 reissue retitled the original &quot;Yallah&quot; as &quot;The Truth Explodes.&quot;] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1994" thumb="/library/metadata/59108/thumb/1445624898" parentThumb="/library/metadata/59107/thumb/1445624755" originallyAvailableAt="1994-01-01" leafCount="14" addedAt="1438445208" updatedAt="1445624898">

Liam personified the former while Noel flew the flag for the latter and their distinct, differing definitions of rock &amp; roll continued to churn out exciting rock &amp; roll until the end, when Liam’s cavalier attitude toward work proved the final straw for the elder Gallagher. Unsurprisingly, the first solo projects from the two reflected this dichotomy: Liam’s Beady Eye is all big-legged swagger; Noel’s High Flying Birds is tasteful, mannered craftsmanship. Noel often griped how Liam would prevent Oasis from doing anything unexpected, thereby raising expectations of left turns on High Flying Birds, but the little brass flourishes peppered throughout the record don’t stop the album from playing like a succession of variations on “Don’t Look Back in Anger” and “The Importance of Being Idle.” Craftsman that he is, Gallagher does come up with several keepers -- the Oasis carryovers “Stop the Clocks” and “(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine,” “If I Had a Gun...,” “Everybody’s on the Run” -- but his success ratio is no greater than it was on the last two Oasis albums, where his best tunes were buttressed by good ones from his brother and Andy Bell. Take the highlights from Beady Eye’s Different Gear, Still Speeding and add them to the highlights from High Flying Birds, and you’ll wind up with a balanced, better record than either individual LPs -- and in a direct competition the elder Gallagher comes up just a little short, as he’s missing anything resembling rock &amp; roll, skimping on quick tempos and loud guitars. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2011" thumb="/library/metadata/61290/thumb/1445626075" art="/library/metadata/61289/art/1445625606" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61289/thumb/1445625606" originallyAvailableAt="2011-01-01" leafCount="10" addedAt="1438447314" updatedAt="1445626075">

By the time of the May 7 Manchester Free Trade Hall gig captured on the bootleg release Now Ain&apos;t the Time for Your Tears, Dylan had already abandoned the protest themes of his classic early anthems to focus on more poetic, personal subjects. The opening &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&apos;&quot; would prove even more prophetic upon his imminent embrace of rock &amp; roll sensibilities, but even at the bitter end of his folkie stage he delivers solo renditions of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; &quot;Gates of Eden,&quot; and &quot;It Ain&apos;t Me, Babe&quot; with the passion and energy they demand, building to a climactic reading of &quot;It&apos;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot; that further foreshadows everything to follow. Essential listening for anyone with even a passing interest in Dylan&apos;s music, Now Ain&apos;t the Time for Your Tears remains one of the definitive releases of this much-bootlegged performance, although it&apos;s worth noting Swingin&apos; Pig&apos;s decision to subject the soundboard-quality tapes to digital touchups, yielding a cleaner listen (albeit with a blunted high end).

They simply reemerge periodically with another full-length of precise but swinging techno, with vocals that somehow create a rather plaintive sense of detachment (Radiohead&apos;s similarity in this area should not be overlooked). More than 2002&apos;s A Hundred Days Off or 1998&apos;s Beaucoup Fish, Oblivion with Bells harks back to Underworld&apos;s 1993 rebirth with the epic Dubnobasswithmyheadman. (Even the cover design and accordion-style liner notes are similar.) The acid techno is firmly in place, with little or no regard for developments in the form after the &apos;80s. Still, unlike other electronica mainstays who have occasionally revealed a little weariness -- either from trying to change or trying to stay the same -- Underworld never sound particularly tired on Oblivion with Bells. Granted, the music is less innovative than before, and also more quiet, which makes Hyde&apos;s vocals more critical than they&apos;ve ever been. Unfortunately, however, they don&apos;t benefit from the scrutiny. &quot;Ring Road&quot; and &quot;Holding the Moth&quot; are particularly odd, utilizing Underworld&apos;s usual cut-and-paste phraseology, but with productions and performances that never come together like their classics &quot;Dark &amp; Long&quot; or &quot;Pearls Girl.&quot; [A bonus edition included a DVD with The Book of Jam, which included video clips, live footage, and documentary material.] ~ John Bush" index="1" year="2007" thumb="/library/metadata/61490/thumb/1445626215" art="/library/metadata/61489/art/1445625740" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61489/thumb/1445625740" originallyAvailableAt="2007-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438448661" updatedAt="1445626215">

Far from running from this pigeonholing, Hard-Fi opens up their second album, Once Upon a Time in the West, with &quot;Suburban Knights,&quot; a pun that reveals the depth of their cleverness just as the second song, &quot;I Shall Overcome,&quot; reveals the depth of their politics, as the title of the &apos;60s protest standard &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; is turned upside down and inward, making it a plea for personal release. Such is the world view of Hard-Fi&apos;s singer/songwriter, Richard Archer, who does pen plenty of anthems about escaping the suburbs or other urban plights, but they&apos;re pulled out of the rock &amp; roll rebel handbook, as he inadvertently hits the clichés hard on Once Upon a Time in the West (which perhaps shouldn&apos;t be a surprise given the title), so desperate to tie himself to his idols (meaning the Clash, particularly Joe Strummer) that he forgets to create an identity of his own. If Archer&apos;s lyrics are a bit textbook, they don&apos;t call attention to themselves, as they&apos;re delivered in his pretty, plain earnest schoolboy voice that itself is swallowed up by the clatter of the band, who also blatantly echo their rock &amp; roll heroes but assemble their thievery in ways that are often accidentally idiosyncratic. They don&apos;t rely on the Clash quite as heavily as they did on Stars -- there are righteous anthems and elastic reggae rhythms, but they don&apos;t dominate the proceedings -- and there still is a strong dose of the Verve, particularly in the spacey urban atmospheres, but there are also traces of Franz Ferdinand&apos;s new wave revivalism, &quot;We Need Love&quot; has an electro hum, and &quot;Can&apos;t Get Along&quot; even dabbles in the bouncy British interpretation of Motown as patented by the Jam. Hard-Fi&apos;s idiosyncrasy comes in how the band doesn&apos;t quite synthesize these together with finesse. Styles rub against each other like sandpaper and stray sounds stick out like shards of glass, which can make for interesting juxtapositions, but not really compelling ones, especially since the noisiest tracks are the least successful songs. Apart from &quot;Can&apos;t Get Along,&quot; Hard-Fi are best when they go for the arena-filling power ballads, which make them not dissimilar to the Manic Street Preachers, another politically minded band who had their breakthrough when they polished their message until it could be swallowed unwittingly by the masses (and, like the Manics, Hard-Fi succumbs to grand gestures, such as the cover art of Once Upon a Time: a blunt &quot;No Cover Art,&quot; a clever conceit somewhat undercut by the band&apos;s name and album title emblazoned above the proclamation). But where the Manics were defiantly intellectual (and often quite odd) beneath that veneer, Hard-Fi on this uneven sophomore album are nothing more than average guys unhappy with their lot in life, so they strike out against whatever targets are at hand, from their hometown to the war on terror, which seem to bother them equally if their even-handed delivery is to be trusted. Perhaps all this misdirected fury and noise is an appropriate soundtrack to 2007, but Hard-Fi would have been better off if they had truly learned from the Clash and railed against the modern world instead of merely reflecting it. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2007" thumb="/library/metadata/62435/thumb/1445626447" art="/library/metadata/62422/art/1445626118" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62422/thumb/1445626118" originallyAvailableAt="2007-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438449745" updatedAt="1445626447">

One eskimO’s mix of pop hooks and trip-hop electronics isn’t entirely different from Leontiou’s solo material, but it does sound like the work of a proper band, with the instruments often receiving as much focus as the vocals themselves. The production often occupies the spotlight, too; “Kandi” swaggers with a deep, bass-heavy groove courtesy of Faithless’ Rollo, and “Givin Up” opens with left-to-right speaker pans before settling into a minor-key chord progression. Leontiou’s vocals are still a bit gauzy throughout, and he descends into James Blunt territory during soft, acoustic ballads like “Chosen One.” When he’s surrounding himself with beat-oriented producers and active bandmates, though, some confidence creeps into his voice, and the instruments that dominate this album -- synthesizers, programmed percussion, effects-laden guitars, and the like -- play well against his bedroom melodies. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/64515/thumb/1445628130" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64514/thumb/1445627359" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438447543" updatedAt="1445628130">

Though Tobin prefers grand orchestral themes over a soup of heavily messed-with samples and cavernous beats that reference turntablist rap, funky breaks, and the hyper-efficient techno of Mouse on Mars, his style ranges much farther afield than any of these. Out From Out Where is yet another link in the chain begun with 1997&apos;s Bricolage, each release bringing him closer to dance nirvana; wildly experimental yet extremely catchy, with only the above-mentioned Mouse on Mars able to rival his consistency and continual improvement. &quot;Back From Space&quot; is a solid opener, and leads well into his superb slice-and-dice job on the aptly named MC Decimal R for the single &quot;Verbal,&quot; with a flamenco guitar and wordless female vocals for added spice. As before, and even more so this time, Tobin spends a lot of time in dark territory. He excels at creating an atmosphere of approaching menace, with short passages of dramatic samples and anxious strings often paving the way for another array of pummeling beats. The focus on a single mood occasionally threatens to lead only to a creative dead end, but Out From Out Where arguably betters its successors by coming together as a single work. ~ John Bush" index="1" year="2002" thumb="/library/metadata/66929/thumb/1445629209" art="/library/metadata/66917/art/1445629197" parentThumb="/library/metadata/66917/thumb/1445629197" originallyAvailableAt="2002-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438444582" updatedAt="1445629209">

OVO is a work based on the intersecting problems of race relations, environmental concerns, family issues, and fairy tales as allegories, violence, and more. And keep in mind that this was to be a visual piece. Gabriel, to meet the challenge for CD, added a ton of multimedia to the musical soundtrack: there is a drawn storybook, The Story of OVO, a view of the installation itself from every angle, and many stopgap notes, drawings, and the like. For the soundtrack, he enlisted the help of collaborators such as Elizabeth Fraser, Neneh Cherry (whatever happened to her third record, the one she did with Tricky?), Richie Havens, the Black Dyke Mills Band, the Electra Strings, Paul Buchanan (of Blue Nile), Adzido, the Dhol Foundation drummers, and Iarla Ó Lionáird from the Afro-Celt Sound System. Needless to say, the music is all over the map, from a rap version of the &quot;Story of Ovo&quot; to an Irish jig to Gabriel&apos;s percussive culture plundering soundscapes and new songs (including a truly dull rework of &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot;) to Eno-like ambiences to folk songs and new songs with Havens and Ó Lionáird singing like the opposite ends of a heavenly choir and Liz Fraser soaring over the Dhol Foundation drummers. It sounds awesome doesn&apos;t it? It should be. But it&apos;s not. OVO sounds labored, choppy, and pasted together, like it is the soundtrack to a visual installation, and feels incomplete without it. This is not a project like Passion was or even Birdy; it&apos;s a pastiche that attempts to be as ambitious as the installation project. And it is ambitious. Unfortunately, musically it isn&apos;t consistent enough to sustain the listener&apos;s interest for the entire length of the recording.

If Vol. 2 is more eclectic than its predecessor, it isn&apos;t quite as thematically consistent, but it does hit greater highs with a greater frequency. Indeed, some of the greatest singles in pop history are here: &quot;Day Tripper,&quot; &quot;We Can Work It Out,&quot; &quot;Paperback Writer,&quot; &quot;Rain,&quot; &quot;Lady Madonna,&quot; &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; &quot;Revolution,&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t Let Me Down,&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko.&quot; All of the aforementioned are staples in the Lennon/McCartney canon, and while George Harrison&apos;s two contributions aren&apos;t as familiar, &quot;The Inner Light&quot; is arguably his best Indian excursion and &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; is a charmingly jaunty tune that points toward his solo career. In the middle of all this, single versions of &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot; appear (the former is stiffer than the LP version, the latter is better than its counterpart), along with the alternate (and superior) &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and the silly yet strangely irresistible &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number).&quot; Overall, the compilation feels a little disjointed, mainly because it covers so much ground so quickly, but that takes nothing away from the quality of the music, since many of these songs rank among the best, most inventive recordings of the pop/rock era. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1988" thumb="/library/metadata/62870/thumb/1445626305" art="/library/metadata/62447/art/1445626185" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62447/thumb/1445626185" originallyAvailableAt="1988-01-01" leafCount="15" addedAt="1438444893" updatedAt="1445626305">

Since the Beatles had an enormous number of non-LP singles, some of their greatest hits -- from &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; through &quot;Hey Jude&quot; -- would not be included on disc if Capitol simply served up straight reissues. They had two options: they could add the singles as bonus tracks to the appropriate CDs, or they could release a compilation of all the non-LP tracks. It should come as no surprise that they chose the latter. In fact, they took it one further, issuing two separate compilations of non-LP tracks, which is fairly appropriate since the Beatles released far more singles and EPs in the first two years of their recording career than they did in the last five. Past Masters, Vol. 1 covers those first two years and, to be fair, there are some cuts that are unnecessary for anyone outside of the hardcore -- only a handful of people will be able to spot the difference in the alternate &quot;Love Me Do,&quot; while German versions of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot; aren&apos;t even good for a chuckle. Still, the sheer number of astounding singles makes this essential, even with its faults. These 17 songs capture the exuberance of Beatlemania while confirming their talents as popcraftsmen (&quot;This Boy,&quot; &quot;Yes It Is&quot;) and proving that they could rock really, really hard (&quot;I Feel Fine,&quot; &quot;She&apos;s a Woman,&quot; the peerless &quot;I&apos;m Down&quot;). Apart from the cuts that are merely rarities, this is a near-perfect compilation that captures the energy and spirit of the Beatles&apos; early years. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1988" thumb="/library/metadata/62901/thumb/1445626316" art="/library/metadata/62447/art/1445626185" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62447/thumb/1445626185" originallyAvailableAt="1988-01-01" leafCount="18" addedAt="1438444878" updatedAt="1445626316">

For this version, the first two discs of the box set were condensed into a single CD, while the third disc, left untouched, was now the second disc. This accentuated one of the weaknesses of the box set, weighting the selections even more heavily toward Simon&apos;s later work. Here, his recordings originally released between 1965 and 1983 (including six Simon and Garfunkel tracks) made up the first disc, and the second disc covered only the period 1986-1993, and really 1986-90, since the only recordings released after 1990 were &quot;Thelma,&quot; an outtake from the 1990 album The Rhythm of the Saints and three performances from the 1991 live album Paul Simon&apos;s Concert in the Park. While the abridgment seemed to have been made with an eye on the British charts, for the most part eliminating only songs that had not been hits in the U.K. (the exceptions being &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Take Me to the Mardi Gras&quot;), the album still didn&apos;t function as a full-fledged greatest hits album, lacking such British chart singles as &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; and &quot;I Am a Rock&quot; (neither of which were on Paul Simon 1964-1993, either). In its choices of material, particularly in the disproportionate number of songs from Graceland and The Rhythm of the Saints, the album reflected the current taste of its subject rather than the expectations of fans, who might have hoped for more hits and more rarities. In an odd way, however, Simon did gratify the latter hope, if only by tinkering, as he had on previous compilations, with the editing and mixing of his familiar recordings. In several cases, the tracks were noticeably remixed, and the lengths of songs changed -- &quot;Loves Me Like a Rock&quot; and &quot;50 Ways To Leave Your Lover&quot; both got shorter, while &quot;Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes&quot; got longer. ~ William Ruhlmann" index="1" year="1993" thumb="/library/metadata/61179/thumb/1445625971" art="/library/metadata/61178/art/1445625551" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61178/thumb/1445625551" originallyAvailableAt="1993-01-01" leafCount="36" addedAt="1438458213" updatedAt="1445625971">

Peace Orchestra is so lovingly crafted, so finely detailed, that comparisons with the glut of trip-hop sinking the market seems almost laughable. A languid clarinet line does a slow waltz with K&amp;D&apos;s oft-used shuffle-beat on the highlight &quot;Meister Petz,&quot; while &quot;Double Drums&quot; works a mutated tech-synth line with strong breakbeats. Kruder&apos;s musical sense comes from a variety of musical capitals, including Rio de Janeiro (the fine, delicate swing), New York (the jazz chords and shadings), East L.A.

Where Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy integrated their influences on each song, the majority of the songs on Physical Graffiti are individual stylistic workouts. The highlights are when Zeppelin incorporate influences together and stretch out into new stylistic territory, most notably on the tense, Eastern-influenced &quot;Kashmir.&quot; &quot;Trampled Underfoot,&quot; with John Paul Jones&apos; galloping keyboard, is their best funk-metal workout, while &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; is their best attempt at pop, while &quot;Down by the Seaside&quot; is the closest they&apos;ve come to country. Even the heavier blues -- the 11-minute &quot;In My Time of Dying,&quot; the tightly wound &quot;Custard Pie,&quot; and the monstrous epic &quot;The Rover&quot; -- are louder, more extended and textured than their previous work. Also, all of the heavy songs are on the first record, leaving the rest of the album to explore more adventurous territory, whether via acoustic tracks or grandiose but quiet epics like the affecting &quot;Ten Years Gone.&quot; The second half of Physical Graffiti feels like Zeppelin are cleaning the vaults out, issuing every little scrap of music they set to tape in the preceding few years. That means that the album is filled with songs that aren&apos;t quite filler, but they don&apos;t quite match the peaks of the album, either. Still, even these songs have their merits -- &quot;Sick Again&quot; is the meanest, most decadent rocker they ever recorded and the folky acoustic rock &amp; roll of &quot;Boogie with Stu&quot; and &quot;Black Country Woman&quot; may be tossed off, but they have a relaxed, offhand charm that Zeppelin never matched. It takes a while to sort out all of the music on the album, but Physical Graffiti captures the whole experience of Led Zeppelin at the top of their game better than any of their other albums.&#xD;&#xA;[Led Zeppelin launched a massive, Jimmy Page-supervised reissue campaign in 2014, where each of their studio albums was remastered and then expanded with a bonus disc of alternate versions (in the case of the super deluxe editions, they were also supplemented by vinyl pressings, download codes for high-resolution digital audio files, and massive hardcover books). All previous expansions featured alternate versions of nearly every song that showed up on the finished album but Physical Graffiti, the first in the series to appear on its lonesome (and the first to show up in 2015), has a mere seven songs on its bonus disc -- less than half of the sprawling double album. Fortunately, most of these seven songs offer something different from the released versions. The &quot;rough orchestra mix&quot; of &quot;Driving Through Kashmir&quot; is nearly identical to &quot;Kashmir&quot; and &quot;Boogie with Stu&quot; has minutely different solos but &quot;Brandy &amp; Coke,&quot; which is a rough mix of &quot;Trampled Under Foot,&quot; is leaner and funkier, emphasizing John Paul Jones&apos; jumping clavinet. A rough mix of &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot; is drier and boasts different guitar solos, &quot;Sick Again&quot; is stripped of Robert Plant&apos;s vocals and sounds appropriately greasy, and &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; is larded up with perhaps too many vocal overdubs, which leaves the reissue&apos;s real revelation as &quot;Everybody Makes It Through,&quot; a very rough and fascinating early version of &quot;In the Light&quot; that&apos;s heavy on keyboards and finds Plant still sorting through his vocal. Like most of the Zeppelin reissues, the alternate versions reaffirm that Page made the right decisions the first time around, but these seven versions all make for worthy listening in their own right.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1975" thumb="/library/metadata/64904/thumb/1445628576" art="/library/metadata/64885/art/1445627605" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64885/thumb/1445627605" originallyAvailableAt="1975-01-01" leafCount="15" addedAt="1438447212" updatedAt="1445628576">

The difference is in the subtlety and restraint of their arrangements; whereas Billy Corgan has trademarked his whisper-to-a-scream dynamics, the Pickups keep the buildups fluid and the crescendos controlled. Oftentimes the listener may find themselves wishing for more explosive release, but things are kept discreet here; after all, it&apos;s easier to effectively follow the quiet-loud-quiet tactics of the Pixies or Nirvana, much more tricky to keep things understated yet filled with tension. Only on the leadoff track &quot;Kissing Families&quot; does lead singer/guitarist Brian Aubert seethe with barely contained rage, &quot;Everything is connected and beautiful, and now I know just where I stand,&quot; a realization that doesn&apos;t seem to please him. Or on &quot;The Fuzz&quot; where the guitars build to a multi-tracked yet muted climax we still aren&apos;t given the payoff we might have expected. This could be attributed to a desire to keep things radio-friendly or in a pop format, perhaps at the advice of a producer, or it could just be the band&apos;s entire modus operandi. Another complaint could be leveled at the Pickups&apos; over-reliance on root-chord eighth-note downbeat strums indicative of bedroom compositions originally aimed for the coffeehouse open mic circuit, but that factor is minor, and while it undermines any overt intensity it adds to the subtle subversiveness of the arrangements. Most seductive is a Moe Tucker-esque turn on vocals by bassist/backup vocalist Nikki Monninger on &quot;Creation Lake&quot;; the simplicity of this song with its childlike keening belies its complicity in the overall disenchantment and ennui that seems to be the theme of this collection. &quot;...All the Go Inbetweens&quot; and an unnamed &quot;hidden&quot; track continue the wistful yet urgent feeling and bring the collection of a mere six songs to a close that feels like a complete album. A great beginning is documented here, and one can see the maturation on their subsequent full-length. One would only hope that the band can continue to find its own distinctive voice. ~ Brian Way" index="1" year="2007" thumb="/library/metadata/64057/thumb/1445627631" art="/library/metadata/64045/art/1445627029" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64045/thumb/1445627029" originallyAvailableAt="2007-01-01" leafCount="7" addedAt="1438448068" updatedAt="1445627631">

The result was For Your Own Special Sweetheart, inarguably the most polished and fully realized album of Dischord alumnus Jawbox&apos;s career. Fast forward ten years and you find Barsuk&apos;s Death Cab for Cutie in the same position, making the same move. A new label, a larger crowd (thanks to their repeated appearances on The OC), and a side project of Ben Gibbard (Postal Service) that very well overshadowed the success of his main project. All of the moves were perfectly aligned to take the little band that could into the rock stratosphere. But the difference between Jawbox and Death Cab for Cutie was that For Your Own Special Sweetheart went on to be the finest release of Jawbox&apos;s canon. Plans definitely comes close to that mark, but falls slightly short. In comparison to the dry, raw production of Transatlanticism, Plans is warm and polished, the kind of album expected from a band obsessed with the sound of Fleetwood Mac&apos;s Rumours. Chris Walla does an amazing job bringing the group&apos;s sound in a different direction than before without compromising too many of the things that made the group sound great to begin with. Thematically, Plans is the Death Cab for Cutie suitable for graduate students, world-weary and wiser from their experiences, realizing they can no longer be love-starved 20-somethings without a clue yet hopelessly cursed to face the same issues. And there&apos;s merit to be had in acknowledging that maturity, for even blink-182 figured out their age and released their &quot;serious&quot; album. Gibbard&apos;s wispy, poetic lyrics (which could easily have been stolen from Aimee Mann&apos;s dressing room while she wasn&apos;t looking) still remain an artery from which the rest of the band beats and are some of his finest ever, but this time around the band aligns itself more with a series of emotional murmurs rather than a heart attack. The album winds its way from one ballad to the next, with brief stopovers at moderately up-tempo numbers to help break things up a bit. And it&apos;s this sense of resignation that either makes or breaks the album, depending on which Death Cab for Cutie is your favorite: the melancholic, hopeless romantic or the one who wears its heart on its sleeve with unbridled energy and passion. If Transatlanticism was Gibbard&apos;s Pet Sounds and Postal Service was SMiLE, then this is definitely Wild Honey, loved by adoring new fans and those who enjoy the ballads. But those hoping for a bit more -- for the bar to be raised higher -- might find this a mildly predictable exercise in Gibbard exorcising the demons of Phil Collins that haunt him. Plans is both a destination and a transitional journey for the group, one that sees the fulfillment of years of toiling away to develop their ideas and sound. But it&apos;s with the completion of those ideas that band is faced with a new set of crossroads and challenges to tread upon: to stay the course and suffer stagnation or try something bold and daringly new with their future. Which road they&apos;ll take will make all the difference.

Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh, precisely because of its intense origins. As the songs rush past, it&apos;s easy to get wrapped up in the sound of the record itself without realizing how the album effectively summarizes the band&apos;s eclectic influences. Naturally, the influences shine through their covers, all of which are unconventional and illustrate the group&apos;s superior taste. There&apos;s a love of girl groups, vocal harmonies, sophisticated popcraft, schmaltz, R&amp;B, and hard-driving rock &amp; roll, which is enough to make Please Please Me impressive, but what makes it astonishing is how these elements converge in the originals. &quot;I Saw Here Standing There&quot; is one of their best rockers, yet it has surprising harmonies and melodic progressions. &quot;Misery&quot; and &quot;There&apos;s a Place&quot; grow out of the girl group tradition without being tied to it. A few of their originals, such as &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot; and the pleasantly light &quot;P.S.

The Beatles may have played notoriously rough dives in Hamburg, but the only way you could tell that on their first album was how the constant gigging turned the group into a tight, professional band that could run through their set list at the drop of a hat with boundless energy. It&apos;s no surprise that Lennon had shouted himself hoarse by the end of the session, barely getting through &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; the most famous single take in rock history. He simply got caught up in the music, just like generations of listeners did. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1963" thumb="/library/metadata/62855/thumb/1445626275" art="/library/metadata/62447/art/1445626185" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62447/thumb/1445626185" originallyAvailableAt="1963-01-01" leafCount="14" addedAt="1438444907" updatedAt="1445626275">

While scant in terms of general info, as a no-frills hit-for-hit collection Pop! lives up to its considerable brief. Taken out of context from the various albums, hearing one straight-up smash after enough becomes a pure delight. It&apos;s intriguing to hear how the pure synth-pop/soul fusions of the earliest years give way to a more fluid style, almost as if the notoriously hard-to-stay-satisfied Clarke, having finally found a perfect partner in Bell, found the time and inclination to explore other options. As for Bell, hearing his evolution from an all-too-obvious clone of Clarke&apos;s Yaz partner Alison Moyet into his own English soul style makes for a treat. Picking out highlights from already powerful material almost begs the question, but hearing the stretch of brilliant songs from the soothing jump of &quot;Oh L&apos;Amour&quot; to the explosive, infectious energy of &quot;Stop!&quot; makes for great listening, Clarke&apos;s arrangements and Bell&apos;s passionate vocals hitting everything song for song. Calling a straightforward, chronologically organized singles collection one of &quot;hits&quot; would be arrogant if it weren&apos;t for the fact that it was also true, almost every number a Top 40 placer at home, more than half hitting the Top Ten -- and it&apos;s never hard to hear why. There is one wryly funny and informative bonus in the liner notes -- without explanation, though unquestionably written by self-confessed gearhead Clarke, a list of classic keyboards he&apos;s used on Erasure&apos;s hits appears with this note: &quot;This is a general list of synthesizers you may or may not be interested in.

Everything Must Go was cathartic, the bandmembers exorcizing their grief after the disappearance of Richey Edwards, but Postcards from a Young Man is as celebratory as the Manics get, a record that recklessly flirts with joyousness. Once again, the band abandons coiled, tense art-punk for anthemic stadium-fillers, creating arrangements so overloaded they threaten to collapse in a tower of sitars, strings, mandolins, fuzz guitars, and cameos from Ian McCulloch and Duff McKagan. The presence of an Echo &amp; the Bunnyman and a Guns N&apos; Roses is typical of the Manics’ almost ludicrous overreach: they blend moody Englishness with American hooks, which has been their plan since the outset, but they’ve rarely been as successful as they are on Postcards from a Young Man simply because they let their penchant for exaggeration run wild. With the notable exception of Nicky Wire’s lyrics -- whose small scale almost seems like a relief after the airing of Edwards’ unused words on Journal -- everything here is bigger than usual, the rhythms packing an unusual swing, the productions scraping the sky, and the hooks spilling out of James Dean Bradfield’s mouth and guitar alike. All this bustle winds up being the rarest of things for the Manics: it is fun. Granted, it is serious-minded fun with ambition, but with Manic Street Preachers you take fun whenever you can get it, and they’ve never sounded as ebullient as they do here. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2010" thumb="/library/metadata/59469/thumb/1445625045" art="/library/metadata/59436/art/1445624878" parentThumb="/library/metadata/59436/thumb/1445624878" originallyAvailableAt="2010-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438453730" updatedAt="1445625045">

With Plant somewhat on the sidelines -- he recorded many of the vocals while in a wheelchair -- Jimmy Page reasserted himself as the primary creative force in the band, helping steer Presence toward a guitar-heavy complexity, perched halfway between a return to roots and unfettered prog. This dichotomy means it feels like Presence sprawls as wildly as Physical Graffiti even though it&apos;s half its length: the four epics tend to overshadow the trio of lean rockers that really do hark back to the Chess boogie and rockabilly that informed Zeppelin&apos;s earliest work. Each of these three -- &quot;Royal Orleans,&quot; &quot;Candy Store Rock,&quot; &quot;Hots on for Nowhere&quot; -- plays as snappily as the throwaways on the second half of Physical Graffiti, containing a sexy insouciance; the band almost seems to shrug off how catchy Page&apos;s riffs and how thick the grooves of John Bonham and John Paul Jones actually are. No matter how much fun this triptych is, they&apos;re lost underneath the shadow of &quot;Achilles Last Stand,&quot; a ten-minute exercise in self-styled moody majesty and the turgid blues crawl of closer &quot;Tea for One.&quot; In between, there are two unalloyed masterpieces that channel all of the pain of the period into cinematic drama: a molten blues called &quot;Nobody&apos;s Fault But Mine&quot; and &quot;For Your Life,&quot; as sharp, cinematic, and pained as Zeppelin ever were. Added together, Presence winds up as something less than the sum of its parts but its imbalance also means that it&apos;s a record worth revisiting; it seems different upon each revisit and is always compelling.

Since Shadow&apos;s prime gift is for instrumentals, the prospect of him collaborating with vocalists is more intriguing than enticing, and Psyence Fiction is appropriately divided between brilliance and failed experiments. Shadow and Lavelle aren&apos;t breaking new territory here -- beneath the harder rock edge, full-fledged songs, and occasional melodicism, the album stays on the course Endtroducing... set. Shadow isn&apos;t given room to run wild with his soundscapes, and only a couple of cuts, such as the explosive opener, &quot;Guns Blazing,&quot; equal the sonic collages of his debut. Initially, that may be a disappointment, but UNKLE gains momentum on repeated listens. Portions of the record still sound a little awkward -- Mike D&apos;s contribution suffers primarily from recycled Hello Nasty rhyme schemes -- yet those moments are overshadowed by Shadow&apos;s imagination and unpredictable highlights, such as Temple&apos;s chilly &quot;Bloodstain&quot; or Badly Drawn Boy&apos;s claustrophobic &quot;Nursery Rhyme,&quot; as well as the masterstrokes fronted by Richard Ashcroft (a sweeping, neo-symphonic &quot;Lonely Soul&quot;) and Thom Yorke (the moody &quot;Rabbit in Your Headlights&quot;). These moments might not add up to an overpowering record, but in some ways Psyence Fiction is something better -- a superstar project that doesn&apos;t play it safe and actually has its share of rich, rewarding music.

The duo employs their guitars to create touching ballads at will, but they forget to vary their pace at times. Quiet Is the New Loud is immeasurably gentle. Comparing the band to Belle and Sebastian and Nick Drake, as so many music critics are prone to do, isn&apos;t quite right. It&apos;s nearly impossible to find a hint of irony in the music of Kings of Convenience, whereas Belle and Sebastian&apos;s Stuart Murdoch seems to have his tongue firmly planted in cheek. Drake sought the mystical and natural elements of his short life to create his art. Kings of Convenience seem to merely seek calm moods and discuss relationships. Acoustic guitars are constantly rolling and a minimal piano plucks out delicate notes. The most interesting songs tend to be those where the band picks up their pace. &quot;I Don&apos;t Know What I Can Save You From&quot; is quite beautiful, as Erik Glambek Boe&apos;s vocals take on a charged immediacy. The song is reminiscent of the more pop-oriented sound Ben and Jason achieved on their excellent Emoticons album. &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; sounds more than a little like a slowed-down, sadder take on Morrissey&apos;s &quot;Seasick, Yet Still Docked.&quot; If Quiet Is the New Loud had a quicker pulse, at least on a few more tracks, it would have been more successful.

Unlike other veteran artists who attempted to come to terms with electronica, Madonna was always a dance artist, so it&apos;s no real shock to hear her sing over breakbeats, pulsating electronics, and blunted trip-hop beats. Still, it&apos;s mildly surprising that it works as well as it does, largely due to Madonna and Orbit&apos;s subtle attack. They&apos;ve reigned in the beats, tamed electronica&apos;s eccentricities, and retained her flair for pop melodies, creating the first mainstream pop album that successfully embraces techno. Sonically, it&apos;s the most adventurous record she has made, but it&apos;s far from inaccessible, since the textures are alluring and the songs have a strong melodic foundation, whether it&apos;s the swirling title track, the meditative opener, &quot;Substitute for Love,&quot; or the ballad &quot;Frozen.&quot; For all of its attributes, there&apos;s a certain distance to Ray of Light, born of the carefully constructed productions and Madonna&apos;s newly mannered, technically precise singing.

This is the very definition of a super-sized album, an album that takes its cues from Queen, its lyrics from science fiction, and its delivery from rock opera. It&apos;s also the first time that Muse has truly sounded like Muse, as few bands since Queen have so readily explored the intersection of bombast and extravagance. The Resistance is most certainly extravagant: there are snatches of classical piano entwined throughout, not to mention bilingual lyrics, concert hall percussion, coronet solos, and song titles like &quot;Exogenesis: Symphony, Pt. 2 (Cross-Pollination).&quot; But the album is also quite beautiful, capable of moving between prog rock choruses and excerpts from Chopin&apos;s &quot;Nocturne in E Flat Major&quot; within the same song. Presiding over the mix is frontman Matthew Bellamy, a man who seemingly aspires to be both Brian May and Freddie Mercury. He plays guitar, pounds the piano, and composes the album&apos;s orchestral parts -- a hefty workload for even the most dedicated of multi-taskers -- but his strongest asset is his voice, a sky-scraping tenor dripping with so much emotion that it&apos;s almost lewd. He croons, whispers, annunciates, and belts with confidence, a combination that makes him one of England&apos;s most dazzling singers in recent memory. And since a virtual mountain of voices is better than a single voice (remember: bigger is better), Bellamy also multi-tracks himself, creating towering stacks of harmonies during songs like &quot;Resistance,&quot; &quot;Undisclosed Desires,&quot; and the colossal &quot;United States of Eurasia (+ Collateral Damage).&quot; &#xD;&#xA;The band&apos;s tendency to pile excess upon excess doesn&apos;t always yield strong results, as there&apos;s a fine line between, say, the anthemic beauty of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and the bizarre Timbaland-meets-Depeche Mode ambiance of &quot;Undisclosed Desires.&quot; Even so, The Resistance is by and large a fantastic record, culminating in a three-song suite that finds the group jumping from classical movements to guitar solos to sweeping, swaggering, operatic rock. Those songs occupy the final 16 minutes of the disc, and while they&apos;d likely make a bigger impact earlier in the track list, their mere presence indicates that Muse is finally growing comfortable with its own aspirations. Black Holes and Revelations may be a more commercial record, but The Resistance is Muse&apos;s most realized effort to date.

Incredibly ambitious for a one-year-later sophomore effort, Ride the Lightning finds Metallica aggressively expanding their compositional technique and range of expression. Every track tries something new, and every musical experiment succeeds mightily. The lyrics push into new territory as well -- more personal, more socially conscious, less metal posturing. But the true heart of Ride the Lightning lies in its rich musical imagination. There are extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers; thrashers that blow anything on Kill &apos;Em All out of the water, both in their urgency and the barest hints of melody that have been added to the choruses. Some innovations are flourishes that add important bits of color, like the lilting, pseudo-classical intro to the furious &quot;Fight Fire with Fire,&quot; or the harmonized leads that pop up on several tracks. Others are major reinventions of Metallica&apos;s sound, like the nine-minute, album-closing instrumental &quot;The Call of Ktulu,&quot; or the haunting suicide lament &quot;Fade to Black.&quot; The latter is an all-time metal classic; it begins as an acoustic-driven, minor-key ballad, then gets slashed open by electric guitars playing a wordless chorus, and ends in a wrenching guitar solo over a thrashy yet lyrical rhythm figure. Basically, in a nutshell, Metallica sounded like they could do anything. Heavy metal hadn&apos;t seen this kind of ambition since Judas Priest&apos;s late-&apos;70s classics, and Ride the Lightning effectively rewrote the rule book for a generation of thrashers. If Kill &apos;Em All was the manifesto, Ride the Lightning was the revolution itself. ~ Steve Huey" index="1" year="1984" thumb="/library/metadata/59356/thumb/1445625059" art="/library/metadata/59355/art/1445624888" parentThumb="/library/metadata/59355/thumb/1445624888" originallyAvailableAt="1984-01-01" leafCount="8" addedAt="1438447442" updatedAt="1445625059">

And even though Paramore&apos;s lead singer, Hayley Williams, is a few years younger, she has a way bigger set of vocal pipes. The two share a similar register, but Williams belts it out with way more control and authority. She may even be more of a respectable pop idol since her image isn&apos;t manufactured to be rebellious and angst-ridden, but she instead appears to be a genuinely sweet girl, bottling up a huge voice and a heart full of lost loves. On Riot! she fills the majority of the punk-pop tunes with tales of emo angst and declarations of boy woes. Although her lyrics can seem contrived, they also feel representative of actual teenage puppy love, where a breakup feels like the end of the world. The songs are all pretty good tunes performed well, with catchy hooks in the vein of Boys Like Girls fronted by a young Shirley Manson(although that analogy might be lost, since most people who like Boys Like Girls probably aren&apos;t familiar with oldies like Garbage.) As with all of the bands on the Fueled by Ramen roster, the band is an energetic troupe of rockers with precise haircuts who rock pretty hard. The production is sparkling and heavily compressed due to the golden hands of David Bendeth, but this is potentially a downside. Since the sound quality is ultra-clean, it makes the listening experience relatively risk-free and also brings attention to the fact that there&apos;s not a lot of ground being broken here. Most songs have an interesting breakdown of some sort in the bridge, which helps break up the entirety of the disc, and there are a few power ballads (think &quot;Don&apos;t Speak&quot;) that work well, but overall there&apos;s a consistent distorted guitar chug and driving beats that never stray too far from Fall Out Boy&apos;s formula. The lack of originality is forgivable when Williams&apos; girlish charm takes over. It&apos;s a lot like the scene in High Fidelity where the jaded record clerks hear Lisa Bonet&apos;s character singing a Frampton song that&apos;s worn to death, but because of her beauty and sweet voice, they love the performance. In the last track, &quot;Born for This&quot; Williams takes a break from her love confessions, and commands everyone to sing like it&apos;s the last song they will ever sing, making for a perfect live show closer. Ultimately, this disc has enormous crossover potential, and will probably appeal to those who are fans of the genre, and for those who aren&apos;t, there&apos;s a good chance of it becoming a guilty pleasure.

This Mexican guitar duo met while in a heavy metal outfit together and soon found the local scene wanting. Both had roots in flamenco and other folk and rock music; they dropped the electric guitars -- and bandmates -- to travel light. They headed off to Europe, and ended up busking in Ireland, where their renown spread as instrumentalists who had to be seen to be believed. They re-recorded an album, toured the U.K. with everyone from David Gray to the Buena Vista Social Club, and then cut a live disc in Dublin and Manchester. That was the story until they hooked up with producer John Leckie. He was able to help them record a studio album that captured the sheer orgiastic excitement of their live gigs, hence this self-titled puppy that debuted in the Irish charts at number one. Uh-huh. It&apos;s true that Ireland&apos;s not a big place, but when, when, have you ever heard of an instrumental recording by a Mexican duo hitting the number one spot in such a place? What&apos;s more, the disc has a buzz on Yank shores as well and with good reason. These nine cuts have nothing to do with nuevo flamenco or any of that new agey stuff: this is smoke and fire music, it burns across genres and traditions like a demented passion spirit that takes no prisoners -- and we can thank the gods for heavy metal in this instance at least. This set slashes like a stiletto; it&apos;s fine and precise; it leaves no scars. The dynamic range of this music is startling. It is both ancient and futuristic, carnally frenetic and romantically seductive, artfully -- and even spiritually -- played yet drenched in the vulgarity of street life. It is the work of two young masters who are still striving to learn and incorporate more without sacrificing beauty, pathos, and tradition. On &quot;Ixtapa&quot; they utilize rock &amp; roll dynamics to perform a song about the place they decided to flee from Mexico City to before leaving for Europe. Roby Lakatos, the incredible violinist, joins the duo here (he&apos;s a fan and offered his services). Take in &quot;Diablo Rojo,&quot; or &quot;Satori,&quot; where metal chops, flamenco, and tango music become entwined in a musical ménage à trois. There are no gimmicks in this music, it&apos;s exactly what you hear in the immediate present that somehow comes out of the Latin historical past, is infected by rock &amp; roll and forwards the secret histories of both. Informed by this, listen closely to the pair&apos;s covers of Metallica&apos;s &quot;Orion&quot; and, more importantly, the song that would be easiest to dismiss -- a reading of Led Zeppelin&apos;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; that takes the apporporiate liberties and makes them both sound fresh and new. In encountering this record, all doubt and cynicism should removed; what is happening here is that the canon for the acoustic, classical guitar is being rewritten. This music is the sound of passion as interpreted by and spoken for in a new rock &amp; roll language.

That&apos;s a swift rise -- one that was years in the making, of course -- but after hearing their self-titled debut, it&apos;s easy to understand their sudden fame: La Roux&apos;s take on &apos;80s synth pop is as unique as it is familiar. La Roux&apos;s inspirations, which include Blancmange and the Eurythmics, might be decades old and well-known, but their spare coldness can still sound weird, and La Roux shows just how committed they are to that chilly oddness and catchiness. They use only the brittlest drums and tinniest synths on these songs -- if anything, it feels like La Roux&apos;s gear is more limited than the original group&apos;s were. They even have the proper synth pop lineup: La Roux is a duo (though singer Elly Jackson gets most of the limelight). However, their devotion transcends kitsch, even if Jackson&apos;s asymmetrical copper wedge of a hairdo suggests otherwise. It also sounds remarkably relevant. Robyn and the Knife are kindred spirits, and in a sea of hyper-feminized pop singers, Jackson&apos;s androgyny is as arresting as Annie Lennox&apos;s was a quarter-century earlier. Yet La Roux aren&apos;t purists. &quot;Tigerlily&quot;&apos;s tough-girl stance mixes 8-bit arpeggios with a creepy, &quot;Thriller&quot;-style spoken word bridge, and &quot;Reflections Are Protection&quot;&apos;s bass and synths nod to electro. While style is a large part of La Roux&apos;s substance, it never feels slick, and that&apos;s due to Jackson&apos;s voice as much as it is the group&apos;s intentionally stiff sounds -- in fact, it&apos;s the way that her vocals interact with those sounds that makes these songs so dynamic. Jackson can be shrill and almost synthetic-sounding when she hits high notes, especially on the breakout hit &quot;In for the Kill,&quot; but her lower register -- which she uses beautifully on &quot;Colourless Colour&quot; -- is throaty and very human. Her characters are either running toward or away from desperate love affairs, but like other skilled popsmiths, La Roux know how to give pain a sweet and shiny veneer. Nowhere is this clearer than on &quot;Quicksand,&quot; which uses a relentlessly tight arrangement and Jackson&apos;s frosty soulfulness to give the song&apos;s obsession a shot of excitement. And though the chart-topping &quot;Bulletproof&quot; is feisty and &quot;As If by Magic&quot; is wistful, both songs use wishes and daydreams as armor against further heartache. La Roux&apos;s dedication to their aesthetic makes this an album where the songs are variations on a theme, and on the rare occasion where the songwriting isn&apos;t razor-sharp, the style threatens to overtake the substance. However, that devotion also makes La Roux a standout, not just among the many other &apos;80s revivalists, but the entire late-2000s pop landscape. ~ Heather Phares" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/59641/thumb/1445625093" art="/library/metadata/59640/art/1445624938" parentThumb="/library/metadata/59640/thumb/1445624938" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438451800" updatedAt="1445625093">

The group and George Martin were also beginning to expand the conventional instrumental parameters of the rock group, using a sitar on &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),&quot; Greek-like guitar lines on &quot;Michelle&quot; and &quot;Girl,&quot; fuzz bass on &quot;Think for Yourself,&quot; and a piano made to sound like a harpsichord on the instrumental break of &quot;In My Life.&quot; While John and Paul were beginning to carve separate songwriting identities at this point, the album is full of great tunes, from &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot; and &quot;Michelle&quot; to &quot;Girl,&quot; &quot;I&apos;m Looking Through You,&quot; &quot;You Won&apos;t See Me,&quot; &quot;Drive My Car,&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; (the last of which was the first Beatles song to move beyond romantic themes entirely).

Prior to this LP, Fleetwood Mac were moderately successful, but here they turned into a full-fledged phenomenon, with Rumours becoming the biggest-selling pop album to date. While its chart success was historic, much of the legend surrounding the record is born from the group&apos;s internal turmoil. Unlike most bands, Fleetwood Mac in the mid-&apos;70s were professionally and romantically intertwined, with no less than two couples in the band, but as their professional career took off, the personal side unraveled. Bassist John McVie and his keyboardist/singer wife Christine McVie filed for divorce as guitarist/vocalist Lindsey Buckingham and vocalist Stevie Nicks split, with Stevie running to drummer Mick Fleetwood, unbeknown to the rest of the band. These personal tensions fueled nearly every song on Rumours, which makes listening to the album a nearly voyeuristic experience. You&apos;re eavesdropping on the bandmates singing painful truths about each other, spreading nasty lies and rumors and wallowing in their grief, all in the presence of the person who caused the heartache. Everybody loves gawking at a good public breakup, but if that was all that it took to sell a record, Richard and Linda Thompson&apos;s Shoot Out the Lights would be multi-platinum. No, what made Rumours an unparalleled blockbuster is the quality of the music. Once again masterminded by producer/songwriter/guitarist Buckingham, Rumours is an exceptionally musical piece of work -- he toughens Christine McVie and softens Nicks, adding weird turns to accessibly melodic works, which gives the universal themes of the songs haunting resonance. It also cloaks the raw emotion of the lyrics in deceptively palatable arrangements that made a tune as wrecked and tortured as &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; an anthemic hit. But that&apos;s what makes Rumours such an enduring achievement -- it turns private pain into something universal. Some of these songs may be too familiar, whether through their repeated exposure on FM radio or their use in presidential campaigns, but in the context of the album, each tune, each phrase regains its raw, immediate emotional power -- which is why Rumours touched a nerve upon its 1977 release, and has since transcended its era to be one of the greatest, most compelling pop albums of all time.

The general gist of the statement was generally true, at least to the extent that they were a prominent part of the next wave, the wave where new wave revivalism truly caught hold. They were lighter than Interpol and far gaudier, plus they were fronted by a guy called Brandon Flowers, a name so ridiculous he had to be born with it (which he was). And although it was hailed to the heavens on various areas of the Net, Hot Fuss became a hit the old-fashioned way: listeners gravitated toward it, drawn in by &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; and sticking around for the rest. Soon, they made the cover of everything from Spin to Q, earning accolades from rock stars and seeing their songs covered on Rock Star, too. Heady times, especially for a group with only one album to its name, and any band that receives so much attention is bound to be thought of as important, since there has to be a greater reason for all that exposure than because Flowers is pretty, right? One of the chief proponents of the belief that the Killers are important is the band itself, which has succumbed to that dreaded temptation for any promising band on its sophomore album: they&apos;ve gone and grown beards. Naturally, this means they&apos;re serious adults now, so patterning themselves after Duran Duran will no longer do. No, they make serious music now, and who else makes serious music? Why, U2, of course, and Bruce Springsteen, whose presence looms large over the Killers&apos; second album, Sam&apos;s Town. &#xA;The ghosts of Bono and the Boss are everywhere on this album. They&apos;re there in the artful, grainy Anton Corbijn photographs on the sleeve, and they&apos;re there in the myth-making of the song titles themselves -- and in case you didn&apos;t get it, Flowers made sure nobody missed the point prior to the release of Sam&apos;s Town, hammering home that he&apos;s just discovered the glories of Springsteen every time he crossed paths with the press. Flowers&apos; puppy love for Bruce fuels Sam&apos;s Town, as he extravagantly, endlessly, and blatantly apes the Springsteen of the &apos;70s, mimicking the ragged convoluted poet of the street who mythologized mundane middle-class life, turning it into opera. The Killers sure try their hardest to do that here, marrying it to U2&apos;s own operatic take on America, inadvertently picking up on how the Dublin quartet never sounded more European than when they were trying to tell one and all how much they loved America. That covers the basic thematic outlook of the record, but there&apos;s another key piece of the puzzle of Sam&apos;s Town: it&apos;s named after a casino in the Killers&apos; home town of Las Vegas, and it&apos;s not one of the gleeful, gaudy corporate monstrosities glutting the Strip, but rather one located miles away in whatever passes for regular, everyday Vegas -- in other words, it&apos;s the city that lies beneath the sparkling façade, the real city. Of course, there&apos;s no real city in Vegas -- it&apos;s all surface, it&apos;s a place that thinks that a miniature Eiffel Tower and a fake CBGB&apos;s are every bit as good as being there -- and that&apos;s the case with the Killers too: when it comes down to it, there&apos;s no &quot;there&quot; there -- it&apos;s all a grand act. Every time they try to dig deeper on Sam&apos;s Town -- when they bookend the album with &quot;enterlude&quot; and &quot;exitlude,&quot; when Flowers mixes his young-hearts-on-the-run metaphors, when they graft Queen choirs and Bowie baritones onto bridges of songs -- they just prove how monumentally silly and shallow they are. Which isn&apos;t necessarily the same thing as bad, however. True, this album has little of the pop hooks of &quot;Mr. Brightside,&quot; but in its own misguided way, it&apos;s utterly unique. Yes, it&apos;s cobbled together from elements shamelessly stolen from Springsteen, U2, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Bowie, Queen, Duran Duran, and New Order, but nobody on earth would have thought of throwing these heroes of 1985 together, because they would have instinctively known that it wouldn&apos;t work. But not the Killers! They didn&apos;t let anything stop their monumental misconception; they were able to indulge to their hearts&apos; content -- even hiring U2/Depeche Mode producers Alan Moulder and Flood to help construct their monstrosity, which gives their half-baked ideas a grandeur to which they aspire but don&apos;t deserve. But even if the music doesn&apos;t really work, it&apos;s hard not to listen to it in slack-jawed wonderment, since there&apos;s never been a record quite like it -- it&apos;s nothing but wrong-headed dreams, it&apos;s all pomp but no glamour, it&apos;s clichés sung as if they were myths. Every time it tries to get real, it only winds up sounding fake, which means it&apos;s the quintessential Vegas rock album from the quintessential Vegas rock band.

If the title suggests that the group is digging further into a preposterous fixation on faux Americana, this grab bag of B-sides, new songs, covers, stray tracks, and re-recordings feels more like a sop to the fans who found the Springsteen worship hard to stomach. There&apos;s not as much Boss here but the ghost of The Joshua Tree still lingers, particularly in the clatter of the echoing Edge guitars, but that&apos;s married to the Killers&apos; studied new wave moves, which is a better fit for that sweeping sound anyway. Better fit doesn&apos;t necessarily mean a perfect fit, however -- the return to the Killers&apos; stylish throb only emphasizes their scattershot songwriting, where they can get elements right but they can&apos;t quite tie it all together. Tellingly, the best moments are leftovers from Hot Fuss -- whether it&apos;s the cool glam groove of the leftover &quot;Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf&quot; or &quot;The Ballad of Michael Valentine,&quot; which does the cod-Americana better than Sam&apos;s Town -- but too much of the newer stuff clatters around pointlessly, all pomp and no circumstance. This goes double for the directionless Lou Reed duet &quot;Tranquilize,&quot; which plays as if Bowie decided to have Lou sing on Tonight, then it goes triple for a stupifyingly silly &quot;Ruby, Don&apos;t Take Your Love to Town,&quot; where the Killers seem like kids in cowboy hats even more than they did when they were kicking around the desert outskirts of Vegas. Covers don&apos;t treat the Killers well at all, as they reveal how hammy Brandon Flowers is at his core (swapping Mark Knopfler&apos;s sly, dry delivery for Flowers&apos; community theater bluster robs &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; of its delicate beauty). When Flowers is in his natural setting, supported by glistening waves of keyboards and guitars that ring like synths, that ridiculous theatricality can be a bit of a guilty pleasure, and Sawdust does indeed contain some moments of grand pomp, but its scattershot nature works against the band as it winds up emphasizing the lingering question from Sam&apos;s Town, that the Killers have a hell of a lot of ideas but they just don&apos;t know what the hell to do with them.

Following an 18-month absence, during which the previous five singles from their chart-topping eponymous debut never left the airwaves, Danny O&apos;Donoghue, Marc Sheehan, and Glen Power return with their follow-up, Science &amp; Faith. Based on the struggle in relationships between men and women rather than the religious themes the title suggests, the trio&apos;s second album isn&apos;t exactly a radical departure, with previous producers Andrew Frampton and Steve Kipner back on board for another set of radio-friendly harmonious guitar pop tracks, all of which sound like they could have been lifted from several other artists&apos; back catalogs. Indeed, opening track &quot;You Won&apos;t Feel a Thing&quot; veers into the stadium rock territory of fellow Irishmen U2, lead single &quot;For the First Time&quot; is the kind of heartfelt acoustic ballad Snow Patrol have based a career on, and the likes of &quot;Exit Wounds&quot; and &quot;Long Gone and Moved On&quot; echo the more commercial moments of Coldplay&apos;s X&amp;Y. Only the military-esque rhythms of &quot;This = Love&quot; offer anything remotely original, with even the bandmembers themselves admitting that the album is more of a continuation of their sound than a transition. Of course, there&apos;s no denying that the Script know their way around a melody, and the likes of the soaring string-led &quot;Walk Away&quot; and hook-laden heartbreak of &quot;Nøthing&quot; feature the kind of epic killer choruses that helped their first album shift a million copies. But swamped by the same safe, repetitive, and unadventurous production, the majority of the ten tracks are indistinguishable from one another, making Science &amp; Faith a solid but pedestrian and uninspiring affair.

Combos like Chromeo and the Electric Six are finding mileage in long-shuttered, retrospectively laughable genres like synth pop and new romantic, and revisiting disco&apos;s most damning elements with a vigor for recombination. The results certainly elicit some snickering, but they can also be too cool -- or, for the insecure, too much of a guilty pleasure -- to ignore. New York&apos;s Scissor Sisters access these ideas and more on their debut full-length for Polygram. The eponymous release is a gleaming composite of epic, unabashedly pretty &apos;70s songwriting and fancy-pants disco hedonism, reflecting the decadent dance-pop afterglow of all that George Michael wrought. &quot;Lovers in the Backseat&quot; is powered by the androgynous groove of Michael&apos;s &quot;Everything She Wants.&quot; &quot;Jealous glances/Now I&apos;m lookin&apos; for another song on the radio,&quot; they sing. &quot;I&apos;ll take it to a side street/In the shadows you can touch one another/And I&apos;ll just watch the show.&quot; This flirty, satiny sexuality tingles in every lyrical inch of Scissor Sisters, as the Sisters save their subtlety for the songcraft. Opener &quot;Laura&quot; is a swaggering, absolutely irresistible update of vintage Stevie Wonder, illustrated with piano breaks and a honking sax. &quot;Take Your Mama&quot; chirps in a high register, a honky chateau dreamland of the Beta Band covering Elton John. All of this wackiness occurs before Scissor Sisters drop their dusky dancefloor version of &quot;Comfortably Numb.&quot; They&apos;re hopped up over a twittering glitterball beat, referencing Frankie Goes to Hollywood and the Bee Gees even as the song functions as a Floyd redux. &quot;I! I! I&apos;ve become...&apos;fortably numb!&quot; As fun as all of this is (and the lip-smack glam of &quot;Music Is the Victim&quot; is very, very fun), the Sisters&apos; revisionism can also get them in trouble. &quot;It Can&apos;t Come Quickly Enough&quot;&apos;s dance-pop is too accurate, getting the bland side way too right, while &quot;Return to Oz&quot; cribs from Pink Floyd without the salve of artful dance club redirection. Still, these missteps are forgivable when pseudonyms like Del Marquis and Paddy Boom populate the band.

The reason for the emergence of a live album came about when TMBG played a successful radio session for the Spin Radio Network, where the duo was joined by its touring band as well as horn players and a rhythm section. They were so impressed with the results that they almost immediately went back and picked out versions of songs that sounded totally different live when compared to the original studio versions (especially the songs &quot;She&apos;s Actual Size&quot; and &quot;Why Does the Sun Shine?&quot;). Included are the &quot;hits&quot; &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot; and &quot;Particle Man,&quot; as well as the brand new track &quot;Doctor Worm.&quot; To prove that they haven&apos;t lost their quirky edge, the album ends with seven unlisted tracks that were written on the spot, in front of their audience. ~ Greg Prato" index="1" year="1998" thumb="/library/metadata/62021/thumb/1445626342" art="/library/metadata/62020/art/1445625917" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62020/thumb/1445625917" originallyAvailableAt="1998-01-01" leafCount="1" addedAt="1438448454" updatedAt="1445626342">

Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band" parentKey="/library/metadata/62447" parentTitle="The Beatles" summary="With Revolver, the Beatles made the Great Leap Forward, reaching a previously unheard-of level of sophistication and fearless experimentation. Sgt. Pepper, in many ways, refines that breakthrough, as the Beatles consciously synthesized such disparate influences as psychedelia, art-song, classical music, rock &amp; roll, and music hall, often in the course of one song. Not once does the diversity seem forced -- the genius of the record is how the vaudevillian &quot;When I&apos;m 64&quot; seems like a logical extension of &quot;Within You Without You&quot; and how it provides a gateway to the chiming guitars of &quot;Lovely Rita.&quot; There&apos;s no discounting the individual contributions of each member or their producer, George Martin, but the preponderance of whimsy and self-conscious art gives the impression that Paul McCartney is the leader of the Lonely Hearts Club Band. He dominates the album in terms of compositions, setting the tone for the album with his unabashed melodicism and deviously clever arrangements. In comparison, Lennon&apos;s contributions seem fewer, and a couple of them are a little slight but his major statements are stunning. &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; is the ideal Ringo tune, a rolling, friendly pop song that hides genuine Lennon anguish, à la &quot;Help!&quot;; &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot; remains one of the touchstones of British psychedelia; and he&apos;s the mastermind behind the bulk of &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; a haunting number that skillfully blends Lennon&apos;s verse and chorus with McCartney&apos;s bridge. It&apos;s possible to argue that there are better Beatles albums, yet no album is as historically important as this. After Sgt. Pepper, there were no rules to follow -- rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse. Ironically, few tried to achieve the sweeping, all-encompassing embrace of music as the Beatles did here. [Sgt.

Instead of Gossard, the focus falls on vocalist Shawn Smith, the sweetly voiced, soul-inspired frontman who also achieved notice later for his own group, Satchel, as well as his project with production legend Steve Fisk, Pigeonhed. On his first major effort, Smith shows excellent control, avoiding the dubious theatricality of the likes of Michael Bolton. His astonishing falsettos have won him Prince comparisons, but he&apos;s no slavish imitator, with a rich tone and sense of hurt. He handles keyboards for the group as well, and his piano and organ parts quite fine and his performance sense generally spot on. His composition &quot;Screen,&quot; especially when it gets to a lovely vocal/piano/bass break towards the end, is a good all-around showcase for his work. As a band, Brad works in traditional but quite effective ways, about as close as the group gets to Pearl Jam in any sense. If anything, in &quot;My Fingers&quot; the group actually has a better anthem than most of what&apos;s on Ten, Smith&apos;s heavily flanged vocals mixed with a stirring Gossard guitar build and rhythms crunch. The group mostly works in two modes -- uplifting, heavier rockers along the lines of &quot;My Fingers,&quot; also including the quietly funky &quot;20th Century&quot; and the great album-finisher &quot;We,&quot; and slower, quieter late-night groovers like &quot;Buttercup&quot; and &quot;Good News.&quot; If not groundbreakers per se, the four always do a fine job, guaranteeing a pleasant listen through and through. Bassist Jeremy Toback&apos;s own vocal turn on the melancholic &quot;Down&quot; isn&apos;t bad either, while the squelchy-voiced &quot;Rockstar&quot; is an amusing little one-off, not to mention the weird rant in the album&apos;s final seconds. ~ Ned Raggett" index="1" year="1993" thumb="/library/metadata/58024/thumb/1445624495" art="/library/metadata/58023/art/1445624409" parentThumb="/library/metadata/58023/thumb/1445624409" originallyAvailableAt="1993-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438448970" updatedAt="1445624495">

Such concentration behooves Shakira, freeing her to release her inner She Wolf, a wild wacko who’s as coo coo as she is carnal. And for as sexy as Shakira is -- crucially, her music is sexy too -- what really gives She Wolf its bite is her inspired nuttiness, how she laments that Matt Damon’s not meant for her, and wishes her ex-lover and his new girl a horrible vacation where the room smells and the toilet doesn’t flush. “Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy,” she sings on the title track with no small trace of humor, and this blend of cheerful weirdness and sick beats -- often supplied by the Neptunes, delivering tough, sensual rhythms in a way they haven’t in a long time, but also John Hill and Wyclef Jean -- is giddily addicting, a celebration of all the strange sensuality that comes out at night.

You&apos;d be wrong. Almost all of the 12 songs on this soundtrack (there&apos;s a 13th track, an excerpt of Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell&apos;s original score) are not only in the movie, but they feature prominently in the film -- which just goes to show that Shrek doesn&apos;t play by the rules of animated features, just like DreamWorks told us in the publicity drive. What that means, though, is that it plays by the soundtrack rules of most mainstream comedies, down to the use of the omnipresent Smash Mouth not once, but twice. The record does take a couple of detours from the conventional though, no doubt thanks to DreamWorks&apos; desire to keep their hip NPR audience and to promote their own artists as well. So, when it does deviate from the norm, it&apos;s for the eels&apos; &quot;My Beloved Monster&quot; (from the 1996 DreamWorks release Beautiful Freak) and for Rufus Wainwright&apos;s cover of Leonard Cohen&apos;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (not heard in the film, where it was sung by John Cale, but Wainwright is part of the DreamWorks family and he has an album coming out a few weeks after the release of Shrek), along with a cover of Joan Jett&apos;s &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; by Halfcocked (again, not in the film, where the original was used) and the Proclaimers&apos; 1988 chestnut &quot;I&apos;m on My Way.&quot; Though these detours are a little questionable, they are enjoyable, but they still don&apos;t alter the character of a record that&apos;s essentially just a soundtrack, without much of the personality of the film it&apos;s attached to.

Unfortunately, though, the album doesn&apos;t have as many surprises as its predecessor; none of the songs here have the same left-field feel as Rufus Wainwright&apos;s version of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (or the John Cale version that actually appeared in the film), although Tom Waits&apos; mischievous, middle-of-the-night &quot;Little Drop of Poison&quot; and Nick Cave&apos;s dignified ballad &quot;People Ain&apos;t No Good&quot; come close. On the other hand, Shrek 2 doesn&apos;t include anything as obnoxious or omnipresent as Smash Mouth&apos;s &quot;All Star&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m a Believer,&quot; although it does feature of plenty of covers, including Frou Frou&apos;s odd techno-pop revision of Bonnie Tyler&apos;s &quot;Holding Out for a Hero,&quot; which turns the song from a fun if overblown AOR anthem into a chilly yet slick lament. Butterfly Boucher&apos;s &quot;Changes&quot; and Pete Yorn&apos;s &quot;Ever Fallen in Love,&quot; meanwhile, have the dubious distinction of being average renditions of great songs; not even David Bowie&apos;s cameo on &quot;Changes&quot; can elevate it (although his duet with Mick Jagger on &quot;Dancin&apos; in the Streets&quot; remains his worst collaboration). And while Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas&apos; version of &quot;Livin&apos; la Vida Loca&quot; isn&apos;t as thorough a deconstruction of a Ricky Martin song as William Hung&apos;s infamous &quot;She Bangs&quot; (or as funny -- albeit unintentionally so -- as his own single &quot;Party All the Time&quot;), it is a dose of silly fun on a soundtrack that is sorely lacking that quality. Jennifer Saunders&apos; &quot;Fairy Godmother Song&quot; -- which sounds like her Absolutely Fabulous character making up words to the Cinderella classic &quot;Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo&quot; -- and &quot;Believe&quot;-esque&quot; version of &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot; also liven up the soundtrack a bit. However, most of Shrek 2 features mopey love songs like Dashboard Confessional&apos;s &quot;As Lovers Go [Ron Fair Remix],&quot; the Eels&apos; &quot;I Need Some Sleep,&quot; and Rich Price&apos;s &quot;I&apos;m on My Way&quot;; they reflect the film&apos;s romantic misadventures between Shrek and Princess Fiona, but these songs don&apos;t make the soundtrack an especially fun listen, particularly considering that the movie is, ostensibly, first and foremost aimed at kids. But Counting Crows&apos; &quot;Accidentally in Love&quot; -- which sounds like a cross between one of their old hits and the BoDeans&apos; &quot;Closer to Free&quot; -- and Joseph Arthur&apos;s &quot;You&apos;re So True&quot; are aimed at those kids&apos; older siblings and parents, making Shrek 2 a lukewarm compromise that isn&apos;t likely to satisfy either audience.

Not surprisingly, the vintage tracks are the best, chief among them the Ramones&apos; &quot;Do You Remember Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll Radio?,&quot; Harry Chapin&apos;s &quot;Cat&apos;s in the Cradle,&quot; and Led Zeppelin&apos;s &quot;Immigrant Song.&quot; However, the older songs are also, by and large, more playful and appropriate for a kids&apos; movie than many of the newer tracks; Wings&apos; &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; is a reminder of how over the top mainstream rock hits could be. As far as Shrek the Third&apos;s more current songs go, Wolfmother&apos;s &quot;Joker and the Thief&quot; comes the closest to matching the energy and presence of the vintage tracks, even if it&apos;s not nearly as inspired (especially compared to Zep, of course). Fergie&apos;s cover of Heart&apos;s &quot;Barracuda&quot; is basically karaoke but still surprisingly good -- and a reminder that she&apos;s a good singer when she&apos;s given good material. The Eels contribute two mellow, cheerfully bittersweet tracks, &quot;Royal Pain&quot; and &quot;Losing Streak,&quot; which set the tone for the feel-good singer/songwriter pop of Matt White&apos;s &quot;Best Days&quot; and Trevor Hall&apos;s &quot;Other Ways.&quot; The soundtrack closes with Shrek-specific songs like Maya Rudolph and Rupert Everett&apos;s duel/duet &quot;Final Showdown&quot; (which quotes lyrics from Queen&apos;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;) and Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas&apos; &quot;Thank You (Falettin Me Be Mice Elf Again),&quot; which young fans of the movie will no doubt love.

While they made good albums -- and each of their albums had its own character -- they shined as a singles band, which is only appropriate for a band raised on new wave, the last golden era of singles. Unlike the grunge and indie bands that populated the first two waves of the alt-rock explosion of the early &apos;90s, No Doubt wasn&apos;t directly inspired by punk, indie, or any underground rock movement; the band was fueled by new wave, in all of its trashy, poppy glory. Above all, they were inspired by ska revival groups like Madness, with their blend of skittish Jamaican-inspired beats and sense of English popcraft, but they also picked up various strands of early-MTV pop, whether it was bits of new wave Blondie, the Police, and Elvis Costello, or the metallic guitar wallop of Van Halen. It was a cheerful, giddy sound that marked a sea change from the sound of the early &apos;90s, when even catchy melodies were cloaked in a sense of gloom. So, with the success of their second album, Tragic Kingdom, in 1996, they kicked off the second wave of the alt-rock boom of the &apos;90s -- the time when the music meant good times, not angst and alienation. While some of the bands that rode on their coattails were unabashed one-hit wonders and commercialized revamps of underground sounds, No Doubt was something rare: a hip mainstream singles band. They were an outgrowth of new wave, releasing indie albums before their big break, and they stayed true to their inspirations while cleverly adding elements of contemporary hits to their sound -- and, in doing so, became a &apos;90s version of a new wave band that placed equal emphasis on hooks, style, videos, and cool, radio-ready singles. &#xD;&#xA;And while they made some strong albums -- in fact, with each record they grew stronger -- their medium was radio singles, as the stellar collection The Singles 1992-2003 illustrates. Spanning 15 tracks, the disc is sequenced like a concert, favoring forward momentum over chronological history, and that&apos;s a point in its favor since it shines a spotlight on individual songs, not eras. More than anything, this highlights No Doubt&apos;s consistency as a singles band, since the defining breakthrough single, &quot;Just a Girl,&quot; is as exciting as both the band&apos;s pre-fame &quot;Trapped in a Box&quot; and the sexy neo-electro grind of &quot;Hella Good.&quot; It also shows that even if lead singer Gwen Stefani grew increasingly assured and sexier over the years (compare the seductive &quot;Underneath It All&quot; to the breathy, naïve &quot;Don&apos;t Speak&quot;) and even if she was always rightly the focal point, the band itself is a muscular, versatile, tuneful outfit, rooted in ska revivals like &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; but equally convincing when turning out spiky pop like the glorious &quot;New,&quot; the hard-rocking &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; and &quot;Ex-Girlfriend,&quot; the sighing ballad &quot;Simple Kind of Life,&quot; or the rubbery, reggae-inflected &quot;Hey Baby.&quot; All these hits are here on The Singles, along with expertly selected album tracks and concert favorites, plus a fine new cover of Talk Talk&apos;s &quot;It&apos;s My Life&quot; that makes the group&apos;s new wave influences explicit. There&apos;s not one major song missing, and the whole package is solid proof that few post-alternative bands were as joyous a singles band as No Doubt. It&apos;s a great collection -- the kind of compilation that satisfies fans of all stripes and converts skeptics. It&apos;s the greatest-hits package that they deserve.

Thick harmonies and economical hooks demonstrate the band&apos;s growth -- they&apos;re no longer ripping off the Strokes, having left the swaggering sounds of Up All Night far behind -- but growth is the very problem with Slipway Fires, whose mature, polished tones might as well have been recorded by middle-aged AOR vets rather than Clash-loving twentysomethings. This is an album of earnest piano ballads and well-scrubbed rock, an album that sports song titles like &quot;North London Trash&quot; but sounds as dirty as early-&apos;80s Fleetwood Mac. At times, the earnest posturing gives way to something like &quot;Tabloid Lover,&quot; a fun, shamelessly trashy romp that sets up shop in the Bangles&apos; pop palace. Another highlight, &quot;Burberry Blue Eyes&quot; is reminiscent of the Feeling&apos;s power pop bounce, but while such a song would sound appropriate on the Feeling&apos;s next release, it&apos;s hard to reconcile the fact that Razorlight -- a band that previously sang about bar-filled evenings and hung-over mornings -- have now traded in their street-smart denim for songs about luxury clothing chains. Enjoying Slipway Fires requires a suspension of disbelief, a conscious separation between the band&apos;s past and the somewhat ludicrous present. Of course, not looking at the outlandishly serious cover art -- in which frontman Johnny Borrell attacks the camera with a smoldering glance, an unbuttoned dress shirt, and a seemingly un-ironic pearl necklace -- may also help.

For a band whose instruments include WWII-era pump organs and other antique items, the factory -- with its label-strewn floors, big empty spaces, and semi-crumbling appearance -- must’ve felt like home. And it was home, at least for the three winter months in which the Low Anthem took up temporary residence inside the place, recording the bulk of their third album with Charlie Darwin producer Jesse Lauter. Smart Flesh, the result of the so-called “Pasta Sauce Factory Sessions” and an additional session in Providence, makes good use of the building, which often functions as a fifth member of the band. The songs are deliberately loose and minimalist -- intricacy tends to get lost in the booming, resonant halls of a factory -- but the substance that remains is strong, potent stuff. High-lonesome folk, bare-boned Americana, and old-timey harmony numbers are the name of the game, and although the band’s use of vintage instruments makes for some fun Wikipedia sleuthing (what are “crotales,” anyway?), the spotlight remains on the songs themselves. Frontman Ben Knox Miller sings with a troubadour’s voice, a combination of Bob Dylan and early James Taylor that lends a pleasantness to anything he sings, even when the lyrics revolve around death. He feels like the obvious leader here -- although everyone sings, he’s the only member to own the frontman role -- but Smart Flesh’s best songs are those that revolve around the band’s four-part harmonies, including the gorgeous “Love and Altar” (a close cousin to Oh My God, Charlie Darwin’s title track) and a cover of George Carter’s “Ghost Woman Blues.” The Low Anthem may be Ivy League grads, but Smart Flesh doesn’t feel like the work of overeducated Generation Y kids thumbing through their parents’ folk LPs -- it feels like the real thing. ~ Andrew Leahey" index="1" year="2011" thumb="/library/metadata/62201/thumb/1445626414" art="/library/metadata/62200/art/1445626019" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62200/thumb/1445626019" originallyAvailableAt="2011-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438448339" updatedAt="1445626414">

All without changing much at all from where the band was before -- David Roback oversaw all the production, the core emphasis remained a nexus point between country, folk, psych, and classic rock all shrouded in mystery, and Sandoval&apos;s trademark drowsy drawl remained swathed in echo. But grand as She Hangs Brightly was, So Tonight That I Might See remains the group&apos;s undisputed high point, mixing in plenty of variety among its tracks without losing sight of what made the group so special to begin with. Though many songs work with full arrangements like &quot;Fade Into You,&quot; a thick but never once overpowering combination, two heavily stripped-down songs demonstrate in different ways how Mazzy Star makes a virtue out of simplicity. &quot;Mary of Silence&quot; is an organ-led slow shuffle that easily ranks with the best of the Doors, strung-out and captivating all at once, Sandoval&apos;s singing and Roback&apos;s careful acid soloing perfect foils. &quot;Wasted,&quot; meanwhile, revisits a classic blues riff slowed down to near-soporific levels, but the snarling crunch of Roback&apos;s guitar works wonders against Sandoval&apos;s vocals, a careful balance that holds. If there&apos;s a left-field standout, then unquestionably it&apos;s &quot;Five String Serenade.&quot; A cover of an Arthur Lee song -- for once not a Love-era number, but a then-recent effort -- Roback&apos;s delicate acoustic guitar effortlessly brings out its simple beauty. Tambourine and violin add just enough to the arrangement here and there, and Sandoval&apos;s calm singing makes for the icing on the cake. ~ Ned Raggett" index="1" year="1993" thumb="/library/metadata/64675/thumb/1445628264" art="/library/metadata/64674/art/1445627425" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64674/thumb/1445627425" originallyAvailableAt="1993-01-01" leafCount="10" addedAt="1438447436" updatedAt="1445628264">

Not only is he prominent in the band&apos;s videos and press, but he scored the biggest hit of his career with &quot;Smooth,&quot; a song he penned and sung for Santana&apos;s 1999 comeback, Supernatural. Even though Matchbox Twenty&apos;s 1996 debut, Yourself or Someone Like You, was a big hit and spawned four radio hits, &quot;Smooth&quot; was bigger than any of them, making Thomas famous, if not exactly a star. Instead of striking out for a solo career in 2000, he returned to his band, releasing Mad Season that year and More Than You Think You Are two years later. While both records had different moods -- the former was polished and radio-ready, the latter hit a little harder -- both found Thomas working as part of a unit, not as a flashy frontman. This may have illustrated how Matchbox Twenty worked as a band; in particular, More Than You Think You Are sounded like the work of a driven, cohesive unit, even the songs weren&apos;t quite up to snuff -- but they also had to sound a little workmanlike, and certainly not the product of the savvy cross-cultural crossover creator of &quot;Smooth.&quot; Given the relatively lackluster reception of More Than You Think You Are, the timing was right for Thomas to launch his official solo career in the spring of 2005. It was time to give his music a new coat of paint, similar to how &quot;Smooth&quot; spun his career in a different direction, and that&apos;s exactly what his solo debut, Something to Be, is: a slick new variation on Thomas&apos; signature sound. &#xD;&#xA;With its anthemic choruses and achingly sincere sentiments, Something to Be is clearly the work of the lead singer/songwriter of Matchbox Twenty, yet it lacks the lean rock-oriented sound of the group&apos;s albums, even if it is helmed by Matt Serletic, who has produced all three of the band&apos;s records. Serletic and Thomas have made a conscious attempt to have this solo album feel lighter, brighter, and a little hipper than Matchbox Twenty&apos;s music, adding slight drum loops and electronic elements to the rhythms while taking Thomas away from strictly guitar-based arrangements. Heavy on keyboards, elastic guitars, horns, insistent rhythms, and even the occasional gospel-inspired backing chorus or worldbeat inflection, this is a far splashier affair than the average Matchbox Twenty album, and that alone would make Something to Be a noteworthy solo record, since it is indeed a different beast than Thomas&apos; regular gig, but the fresher sound is married to a strong set of songs that play to his strengths as a craftsman of big, anthemic post-alternative mainstream rock. This isn&apos;t edgy work by any means -- and for as hooky and chorus-driven as it is, it&apos;s music that becomes memorable through repeated plays, never quite catching hold upon the first listen -- but it&apos;s more colorful and well-constructed than a lot of contemporary mainstream rock in the mid-2000s, and it&apos;s arguably more appealing than Matchbox Twenty&apos;s earnest guitar rock, which can occasionally seem rather drab. With Something to Be, Thomas delivers an album that is at once familiar and fresh. It may not be something to win over the doubters, but it&apos;s enough to give him a promising new beginning to the second decade of his recording career, not unlike how &quot;Smooth&quot; helped propel him through the post-grunge fallout of the new millennium. [Something to Be is one of the first albums to be released solely as a DualDisc -- a disc that contains a CD of the album on one side and a DVD of the album with extras on the second side. The DVD contains a 5.1 mix of the album, lyrics for the 12 songs (these lyrics are also printed in the album&apos;s booklet), a link to Thomas&apos; website, a plug for his charity Sidewalk Angels Foundation, a photo gallery containing nine photos, and a 20-minute making-of-the-album documentary that contains footage of Thomas writing, Thomas singing a lead vocal, John Mayer recording his cameo, and, finally, a photo shoot with Thomas.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2005" thumb="/library/metadata/58979/thumb/1445624842" art="/library/metadata/58978/art/1445624725" parentThumb="/library/metadata/58978/thumb/1445624725" originallyAvailableAt="2005-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438452150" updatedAt="1445624842">

Of course, that time would be the mid-&apos;70s, when the band was golden gods, selling out stadiums across America and indulging their wildest desires both on and off stage. It was the kind of excess that creates either myth or madness, and this 1976 live album -- comprised of highlights from their three shows at Madison Square Garden during July 1973 -- has its fair share of both, as Zeppelin sounds both magnificent and murky as they blow up songs from their first five albums to a ridiculously grand scale. This is not the vigorous, vicious band documented on the subsequently released live BBC Sessions or the majestic might of the 2003 live album How the West Was Won and its accompanying eponymous DVD, where the band still sounded tight even when they stretched out for 20 minutes. Here, on a show documented just about 18 months after those on How the West, the group is starting to let their status as stars go to their head ever so slightly. They no longer sound hungry; they sound settled, satisfied at their status as rock overlord, and since a huge part of Zeppelin&apos;s appeal is their sheer scale, hearing them at their most oversized on The Song Remains the Same is not without its charm. This, more than any of their studio albums, captures both the grandiosity and entitlement that earned the band scorn among certain quarters of rock critics and punk rockers in the mid-&apos;70s, which makes it a valuable historical document in an odd way, as the studio records are such magnificent constructions and the archival live albums so powerful. Plus, there is a certain sinister charm to the sheer spectacle chronicled on The Song Remains the Same, particularly in the greatly expanded 2007 reissue, which adds six previously unreleased tracks, helping pump up this already oversized album into something truly larger than life. At this stage, Zeppelin only seemed concerned with pleasing themselves, but they only did so because they could -- others tried to mimic them, but nobody could get the sheer size of their sound, which was different yet equally monstrous on-stage as it was on record. It wasn&apos;t as consistent on-stage as it was on record -- a half-hour &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; may be the stuff of legend, but it&apos;s still a chore to get through -- but the very fact that Led Zeppelin could take things so far is part of their mystique, and nowhere is that penchant of excess better heard than on The Song Remains the Same. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1976" thumb="/library/metadata/64886/thumb/1445628590" art="/library/metadata/64885/art/1445627605" parentThumb="/library/metadata/64885/thumb/1445627605" originallyAvailableAt="1976-01-01" leafCount="9" addedAt="1438447256" updatedAt="1445628590">

After the band&apos;s demise in 1999, frontman Adam Levine surrounded himself with New York City&apos;s urban hip-hop culture and found a new musical calling. Maroon 5 were born and their debut album, Songs About Jane, illustrates an impressive rebirth. It&apos;s groovy in spots, offering bluesy funk on &quot;Shiver&quot; and a catchy, soulful disposition on &quot;Harder to Breathe.&quot; &quot;Must Get Out&quot; slows things down with its dreamy lyrical story, and Levine is a vocal dead ringer for Men at Work&apos;s Colin Hay. Don&apos;t wince -- it works brilliantly. Songs About Jane is love-drunk on what makes Maroon 5 tick as a band.

The 11-track set showcases this precocious artist on guitar (electric and acoustic) and with a substantial vocal presence that blends innocence, passion, vulnerability, yearning, intensity, and tenderness all in one voice. She also has a knack for crafting melodic vocal leads, which further define her infectious sound. However, what truly shine through are the young musician&apos;s lyrics -- she handles much of the songwriting -- which are some of the most open, simple, and idealistic ruminations on love to drop in 2001. It&apos;s no surprise that the disc&apos;s first single release, the lively and heartfelt &quot;Everywhere&quot; -- with its electric guitar power chords, spirited vocal delivery, and catchy chorus -- spread like wildfire on the radio. Elsewhere, the sugary mid-tempo rock ballad &quot;You Get Me&quot; is an endearing and clever spin on the romantic pairing of two misfits. There&apos;s nothing more fulfilling and powerful than having the unconditional understanding, acceptance, and love of another, particularly for those a bit &quot;left of center,&quot; as the song explains, and Branch well captures the essence of this life treasure. The album&apos;s most captivating moment is the mesmerizing &quot;Drop in the Ocean,&quot; which, to be sure, symbolizes Branch&apos;s Spirit Room. On it her voice, backed by slow and building synth chords, departs from its usual energetic sound and becomes throaty, deep, and ethereal. And Branch&apos;s lyrics -- &quot;Love took me by the hand/love took me by surprise/love led me to you/and love opened up my eyes/I was drifting away like a drop in the ocean, now I realize/that nothing has been as beautiful as when I saw heaven&apos;s skies/in your eyes&quot; -- take the musical depiction of love to a spiritual level, and that doesn&apos;t happen often in contemporary pop/rock, particularly not by a 17-year-old. Of note is producer John Shanks&apos; (Stevie Nicks, Melissa Etheridge, and BBMak, among others) great mix; textured backing vocals and overdubs, a creative use of drum machines, modern beat sounds, and turntables set to a backdrop of rock music, put a fresh spin on the genre. No doubt, Branch is an artist with a bright future, and that&apos;s lucky for music listeners. She has enough spirit to fill not just one room, but many.

(Hint: It wasn&apos;t just the fact that Britain began factoring download data into its chart equations.) If St. Elsewhere sounds like one of the best rap-based pop productions since the second Gorillaz album, then look no further than the common link, producer Danger Mouse. And if the vocal performances are twisted with the type of unbalanced wisdom not seen in pop music since Sly Stone (or at least OutKast), credit Cee-Lo Green, the former Goodie Mob seer/sage/freak. A pop album straight through, St. Elsewhere is as good as Danger Mouse&apos;s two earlier landmarks (Gorillaz&apos;s Demon Days and Danger Doom&apos;s The Mouse and the Mask), but not because of any inherent similarities in the three records. The reasons for greatness here include DM&apos;s uncommon facility for writing (or sampling) simple hooks that stick, his creation of productions that entertain but don&apos;t detract from the main action, and his ability to coax a parade of enticing vocal performances from Green. The hit &quot;Crazy&quot; and the title track are perfect examples. Over detached backings, Green croons, growls, scats, and generally delivers fine neo-soul vocals while Danger Mouse blankets the tracks with choruses of disembodied harmonies and a well-placed string section or crackling organ to conjure an appropriately minor chord atmosphere. The focus on instability doesn&apos;t end there -- paranoia, suicidal tendencies, and multiple personalities are all in the cards, and there&apos;s also &quot;Necromancer&quot;: &quot;She was cool when I met her, but I think I like her better dead.&quot; Then, just to make sure listeners understand this is a concept album and not a message from a mind playing tricks on itself, they drop &quot;The Boogie Monster&quot; (although even the lyrics here can give pause: &quot;I used to wonder why he looked familiar, and then I realized it was a mirror&quot;). With the help of Danger Mouse&apos;s platinum ear and intricate vocal productions, Green is revealed as a top-notch post-millennial soul singer. Even when he&apos;s floating another mass of wise, serene gibberish, DM simply drops another production trick to keep things tight. Much like DJ Shadow&apos;s The Private Press, Danger Mouse relies on samples from the downcast end of obscure &apos;60s pop -- prog, psych, and Italian soundtrack music (his most valuable lieutenant here, Daniele Luppi, has the requisite Italian connection). Although Gnarls Barkley topping the charts was a slight fluke, the excellence of St. Elsewhere could have been seen coming a mile away. ~ John Bush" index="1" year="2006" thumb="/library/metadata/63597/thumb/1445627069" art="/library/metadata/63596/art/1445626556" parentThumb="/library/metadata/63596/thumb/1445626556" originallyAvailableAt="2006-01-01" leafCount="14" addedAt="1438457022" updatedAt="1445627069">

Sure, 1991&apos;s breakthrough Blood Sugar Sex Magik was as long as a classic double LP, but such distinctions mattered little in the era when vinyl gave way to CD, and they matter less now, as the CD gradually gives way to digital-only releases. In fact, like how Blood Sugar was the tipping point when the LPs ceded ground to CDs, Stadium Arcadium could be seen as the point when albums were seen as a collection of digital playlists. Yes, it&apos;s pressed up as a two-disc set -- including an extravagant but pointless special edition housed in a clunky box that includes a make-yer-own-spinning-top -- but this is an album that&apos;s designed for you to mix and match, create your own playlist, rip and burn on your own. It&apos;s designed for you to sequence its 28 songs in some kind of cohesive manner, since the band sure didn&apos;t take the time to do that here; it&apos;s the first major album by a major band that makes as much sense on random as it does in its proper sequencing. Well, that&apos;s not entirely true: the official 28-song album does begin with &quot;Dani California,&quot; the clearest single here, the one thing that truly grabs attention upon first listen and worms its way into your subconscious, where it just won&apos;t let go, as so much of Anthony Kiedis&apos; catchiest melodies do. After that, it&apos;s a long, winding path of alternately spacey and sunny pop, ballads, and the occasional funk workout that used to be the Chili Peppers&apos; signature but now functions as a way to break up the monotony. And there needs to be something to break up the monotony, not because the music is bad but because it all exists at the same level and is given a flat, colorless production that has become the signature of Rick Rubin as of late. &#xD;&#xA;Rubin may be able to create the right atmosphere for Flea and John Frusciante to run wild creatively -- an opportunity that they seize here, which is indeed a pleasure to hear -- but he does nothing to encourage them to brighten the finished recording up with some different textures, or even a greater variety of guitar tones. As such, the bare-bone production combined with the relentless march of songs gives Stadium Arcadium the undeniable feel of wading through the demos for a promising project instead of a sprawling statement of purpose; there&apos;s not enough purpose here for it to be a statement. That fault is down to the band not forming the raw material into something palatable for the listener, but there&apos;s also the problem that as a lyricist Anthony Kiedis just isn&apos;t that deep or clever enough to provide cohesive themes for an album of this length; he tackles no new themes here, nor does he provide new insight to familiar topics. To his credit, he does display a greater versatility as a vocalist, cutting back on the hambone rapping that used to be his signature and crooning throughout the bulk of this album, usually on key. That said, he still has enough goofy tics to undercut his attempts at sincerity, and he tends to be a bit of a liability to the band as a whole; with a different singer, who could help shape and deliver these songs, this album might not seem as formless and gormless. But there is a fair amount of pleasures here, all down to the interplay between Flea and Frusciante. While drummer Chad Smith does prove himself quite versatile here, gracefully following the eccentric turns and meanderings of the bassist and guitarist, the string instruments are the reason to listen to Stadium Arcadium. That&apos;s always been the case to a certain extent with the Chili Peppers, but here it&apos;s especially true, as they push and pull, rave and rumble, lie back and rock out -- pretty much spit out anything they can do on their instruments over the course of 28 songs. As good as much of this is, there is a little bit of monotony here, since they&apos;re working variations on their signature themes, and they haven&apos;t found a way to make these variations either transcendent or new; they&apos;re just very good renditions on familiar themes. These tracks rarely betray their origins as studio jams -- more than ever, it&apos;s possible to hear that the track came first, then the song -- and while that can result in some good listening, it all does kind of drift together. That said, there are no bad tracks here -- it&apos;s all of a relatively high quality -- but there are no standouts either, so it takes a very dedicated fan to start sorting out the subtleties between the tracks (not the wheat from the chafe, since it&apos;s all wheat). And while those hardcore fans may certainly enjoy the make-your-own-adventure spirit of Stadium Arcadium, it&apos;s hard not to feel that it&apos;s the band&apos;s responsibility to take this very good repetitive album and mold it into something sharper and more effective. So call it the rock version of Peter Jackson&apos;s King Kong: there&apos;s something pretty great and lean buried beneath the excess, but it&apos;s so indulgent, it&apos;s a work that only a fanboy could truly love. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2006" thumb="/library/metadata/60968/thumb/1445625831" art="/library/metadata/60967/art/1445625493" parentThumb="/library/metadata/60967/thumb/1445625493" originallyAvailableAt="2006-01-01" leafCount="28" addedAt="1438453169" updatedAt="1445625831">

This may be an artifact of the digital age, however -- that fabled, oft-mentioned &quot;transparency.&quot; Regardless, Star Wars fans will thrill at the sound of it. What&apos;s open to question is whether or not long-term fans will be as overjoyed with the remainder of the score. Composer John Williams continues to use his Boston Pops experience to good advantage, turning in a score that echoes the music and themes for the original trilogy of films (particularly the brooding theme for Darth Vader) while charting a direction for the new film. The multi-themed &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;, in particular, uses the complete dynamic range of the digital studio for an effective punch. Of course, &quot;new&quot; is a relative term when it comes to film music; Williams&apos; use of dramatic dissonance and discordance is somewhat innovative for the Star Wars series, as are the bravura choral passages, the score deliberately references the great film composers of the &apos;30s and &apos;40s. Just as George Lucas intended his movie to reflect an earlier time in the life of his universe, Williams&apos; music follows suit, with choral passages that bring to mind both Prokofiev and Carl Orff (insofar as the choral material brings to mind Orff&apos;s interpretation of the Carmina Burana). &#xD;&#xA;The Episode I score bears more consideration than the trio of earlier scores, and it is a small regret that more material was not included (thus making this a two-CD set that would fit nicely with the special edition releases of the originally trilogy scores.) The overall development of Williams&apos; musical palette bodes well for the greater emotional requirements of Episode II. ~ Steven McDonald" index="1" year="1999" thumb="/library/metadata/62213/thumb/1445626412" art="/library/metadata/62212/art/1445626048" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62212/thumb/1445626048" originallyAvailableAt="1999-01-01" leafCount="17" addedAt="1438447970" updatedAt="1445626412">

A year later, the Staines, England, foursome had a Mercury Music Prize nomination under its belt as well as two Brit Awards nods and a U.K. number one album. Those following the buzz on the other side of the Atlantic finally got their wish with the domestic release of Stars of CCTV in mid-March. With the popularity of Franz Ferdinand, Kasabian, and the Kaiser Chiefs simmering down around this time, Hard-Fi stepped into the American pop conscience when they were supposed to. While their spark and spunk are near matches of those aforementioned acts, Hard-Fi delivers more of an angst kind of performance. Frontman Richard Archer is fueled by Tony Blair&apos;s England. After all, these are four friends from a southwest London town. They sound like a garage band while delving into the monotony of everyday suburban life, referring to their small town upbringing. Thus a raw kind of work ethic gradually emerges on Stars of CCTV. Their formula of snappy choruses and tight guitar hooks, particularly on &quot;Middle Eastern Holiday&quot; and &quot;Gotta Reason,&quot; captures Hard-Fi&apos;s youthful presentation. Archer&apos;s boyish vocals switch off between gritty and playful. If &quot;Living for the Weekend&quot; does not convince you of Hard-Fi&apos;s anxious effort in getting you to ease up on the ho-hum of working for a living, the fresh disco beats of &quot;Hard to Beat&quot; surely will. Hard-Fi&apos;s desire to create something solid enjoyable in the midst of everyday monotony is what makes Stars of CCTV an enjoyable first effort. Whether they are singing about having little money, unexpected pregnancy (&quot;Cash Machine&quot;), or a war-torn world (&quot;Feltham&apos;s Singing Out&quot;), Hard-Fi looks for something positive. Stars of CCTV offers a reason to look for something positive, too. ~ MacKenzie Wilson" index="1" year="2006" thumb="/library/metadata/62423/thumb/1445626449" art="/library/metadata/62422/art/1445626118" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62422/thumb/1445626118" originallyAvailableAt="2006-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438455153" updatedAt="1445626449">

And what sessions they were to have such a wealth of superb material that was leftover. Showcasing Coil&apos;s diversity, the album veers from the orchestrated classicisms of &quot;Original Chaostrophy&quot; and &quot;Corybantic Ennui&quot; to the slow, mutant lounge shuffle of &quot;Omlagus Garfungiloops&quot; and the utter despair of &quot;Who&apos;ll Fall?&quot; The last track there is a highlight, a detuned guitar and phone line noises underscore a harrowing answering machine message from someone who&apos;s friend has just committed suicide. Haunting in its execution and utterly compelling. The peak of the album, and one of the band&apos;s best songs, &quot;NASA-Arab,&quot; is placed in the middle of the album, and like the main pole in a circus tent, supports everything around it. Multiple swirling keyboard lines cross paths with a groovy bassline and the strangest syncopated drums on this planet. Close listening will bring about a trance-like state in the listener.

A decade later, an older, presumably wiser Gallagher realized that if you&apos;re about to leave your longtime label and that label will release a compilation whether you participate or not, it&apos;s better to write your own draft of your band&apos;s history than having the label do it for you. And so Gallagher designed the first Oasis hits compilation, 2006&apos;s double-disc, 18-track Stop the Clocks. As he so often has done in his career, he looked to the Beatles for guidance, choosing their two 1973 hits comps 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 -- better known as The Red Album and The Blue Album -- as a template for Stop the Clocks. Those records mixed up hits with album tracks and B-sides to offer an overview of the band&apos;s identity, and so it is with Oasis&apos; double-disc set, as it overlooks big hits -- &quot;Roll with It,&quot; &quot;D&apos;You Know What I Mean,&quot; &quot;Stand by Me&quot; -- in favor of things that were tucked away on albums or singles. Where the Beatles albums sampled more or less equally from each phase of their career, Gallagher is a bit more ruthless in rewriting his own history, thoroughly excising 1997&apos;s Be Here Now from the band&apos;s past -- an overreaction that&apos;s nevertheless perfectly in line with everything regarding their overblown third album.&#xD;&#xA;Such fits of pique are typical for Gallagher and Oasis -- which at the time of the release of Stop the Clocks had only his brother Liam as the other remaining original member -- and another is the exclusion of the non-LP Christmas 1994 single &quot;Whatever,&quot; omitted presumably because if it were here the band would have to shell out royalties to David Bowie. But even if &quot;Whatever&quot; is missed along with such other great singles both early (&quot;Shakermaker&quot;) and late (&quot;The Hindu Times&quot;), Stop the Clocks works at its most basic level: it offers an excellent primer to Oasis at their best. Of course, this means that it draws very heavily on the glory days of 1994-1996, offering five tracks each from Definitely Maybe and (What&apos;s the Story) Morning Glory, plus various B-sides from this era. All in all, a whopping 15 of the 19 tracks here date from this time, and the four songs that do come from the 21st century -- &quot;Lyla,&quot; &quot;The Importance of Being Idle,&quot; &quot;Go Let It Out,&quot; &quot;Songbird&quot; -- more than hold their own since they rely on what has always been their strengths: sturdy classicist songwriting and spirited performances. And that&apos;s why Oasis&apos; best music has dated very well: anything with such aspirations to be classic lives and dies by the strength of their material, and this manages to capture its time and transcend it, since its attitude remains potent, and the songs sound as good hundreds of times after their fist spin. No, even at two discs Stop the Clocks doesn&apos;t contain all of the best of Oasis, but it does contain Oasis at their best and enough of it that it can indeed be passed along to future generations as an introduction to one of the best bands of their time, just like how the Red and Blue albums converted many young listeners to the Beatles.

The net result easily calls Yes to mind, but Steven Wilson&apos;s not so high-pitched as Jon Anderson and Richard Barbieri completely avoids Rick Wakeman&apos;s extreme idiocies -- prog that knows when less is more. With that as a fine signal for the album as a whole, Stupid Dream takes it from there -- Wilson as a songwriter and singer both sounds recharged and more ambitious, while the group collectively pours it on. The loud passages feel truly sky-smashing, the calmer ones perfectly close, and the overall sense of build and drama -- &quot;A Smart Kid&quot; is a fine example -- spot-on. Strings from the East of England Orchestra and guest work on Wilson&apos;s sometime Bass Communion partner Theo Travis add even lusher atmospheres without swamping the tunes. As always, the group isn&apos;t afraid to experiment where others merely re-create -- check out the funky breaks Colin Edwin and Chris Maitland lay down on &quot;Slave Called Shiver,&quot; not to mention Wilson&apos;s catchy piano figure and Barbieri&apos;s Hammond organ fills. Lyrically, Wilson comes up with some of his best work yet. &quot;Piano Lessons&quot; looks back on past musical learning and a doubtful teacher as a spur to trying harder, while &quot;Pure Narcotic&quot; offers up a romantic scenario and tip of the hat to Radiohead all at once: &quot;You keep me hating/You keep me listening to The Bends.&quot; There&apos;s actually a musical hint or two of the Oxford quintet as well -- the acoustic guitar/drum intro to &quot;This Is No Rehearsal&quot; is a good example -- but leave it to Porcupine Tree to drop in some fully plugged in thrash metal, as well.

After six years of filling dancefloors with his adrenaline-pumping brand of breakneck rhythms and warbling techno synths, he&apos;s recently scored his first Top 40 single, produced a number three hit for Example, and been asked to remix tracks for the likes of Dizzee Rascal, Basement Jaxx, and the Prodigy. His long-awaited, self-titled debut still focuses on his trademark sound, but also incorporates an eclectic fusion of futuristic house, dubstep, and electro-rock on 13 self-penned tracks which cleverly transcend his drum&apos;n&apos;bass beginnings. The spacy, orchestral first minute of atmospheric opener &quot;Let the Story Begin,&quot; which echoes the neo-classical pop of Vangelis, indicates immediately that the album is more than just an extension of his DJ sets. &quot;Could This Be Real&quot; combines Linden Reeves&apos; soulful tones with crunching basslines and huge &apos;90s-inspired Italo house chords. &quot;Move Higher&quot; starts off with Fatboy Slim-esque breakbeats before amalgamating into a mesmerizing old-school electro-house stomper, complete with dirty subwoofer riffs and flashes of infectious ragga vocals, while &quot;Rock It&quot; is a body-popping slice of synth-funk, which borrows the same Breakwater sample as Daft Punk&apos;s &quot;Robot Rock.&quot; Best of all is the hypnotic &quot;Vapourise,&quot; which blends pulsating &apos;80s drums, ambient new age electronica, piercing synth strings, and sinister, robotic spoken word to produce an intriguing but unsettling potential sci-fi theme. The album isn&apos;t as interesting when he reverts to more familiar territory. The understated &quot;Splash&quot; omits the I Blame Coco vocals featured on the single release, but its low-key, eerie, X-Files-esque instrumentation still provides a welcome change of pace from the album&apos;s prevalent frenetic nature, but &quot;Timewarp&quot; is a rather deranged dirge which wanders aimlessly over a repetitive, techno-charged five minutes, &quot;Triple X&quot; is a derivative acid-house-fused number which wrongly suggests the drum&apos;n&apos;bass genre hasn&apos;t moved on in the last 20 years, and the unusual use of a cowbell is the only inventive touch on the formulaic &quot;Follow the Light.&quot; Die-hard drum&apos;n&apos;bass fans may grumble at the sound&apos;s continuing diversion into other dance genres, but Sub Focus is undoubtedly at its strongest when it does just that. Skip past the generic offerings and it&apos;s an often exhilarating listen which heralds the arrival of a potential new dance supremo. ~ Jon O&apos;Brien" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/63945/thumb/1445627526" art="/library/metadata/63944/art/1445626944" parentThumb="/library/metadata/63944/thumb/1445626944" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="13" addedAt="1438448174" updatedAt="1445627526">

Fleet Foxes feel like they&apos;re singing to, and for, themselves on the EP, particularly on the title track, which lingers on their harmonies before drifting off on an acoustic guitar melody. Even on &quot;Drops in the River,&quot; which builds from similarly simple beginnings to big drums and plugged-in guitars, the gentle beauty of the Foxes&apos; melodies remains the same.

Clive Davis, the man who had signed Santana to Columbia in 1968, offered him the opportunity to set up shop at his label, Arista. In the tradition of comebacks and label debuts by veteran artists in the &apos;90s, Supernatural, Santana&apos;s first effort for Arista, is designed as a star-studded event. At first listen, there doesn&apos;t seem to be a track that doesn&apos;t have a guest star, which brings up the primary problem with the album -- despite several interesting or excellent moments, it never develops a consistent voice that holds the album together. The fault doesn&apos;t lay with the guest stars or even with Santana, who continues to turn in fine performances. There&apos;s just a general directionless feeling to the record, enhanced by several songs that seem like excuses for jams, which, truth be told, isn&apos;t all that foreign on latter-day Santana records. Then again, the grooves often play better than the ploys for radio play, but that&apos;s not always the case, since Lauryn Hill&apos;s &quot;Do You Like the Way&quot; and the Dust Brothers-produced, Eagle-Eye Cherry-sung &quot;Wishing It Was&quot; are as captivating as the Eric Clapton duet, &quot;The Calling.&quot; But that just confirms that Supernatural just doesn&apos;t have much of a direction, flipping between traditional Santana numbers and polished contemporary collaborations, with both extremes being equally likely to hit or miss. That doesn&apos;t quite constitute a triumph, but the peak moments of Supernatural are some of Santana&apos;s best music of the &apos;90s, which does make it a successful comeback.

As the organizer of Lilith Fair, McLachlan was on the cover of magazines across America and Canada, which helped Surfacing debut at number two on the U.S. charts -- a particularly remarkable feat since its predecessor, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, peaked at number 50. All the commercial success and media hype disguised the fact that Surfacing not only didn&apos;t offer anything new from McLachlan, but it wasn&apos;t a particularly strong consolidation of her talents. That it isn&apos;t to say it&apos;s a bad record, because it certainly isn&apos;t -- there are several fine songs on the album, including the single &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; -- but it doesn&apos;t offer anything new, and the songs aren&apos;t as consistently captivating as they were on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.

And with the growing omnipresence of big beat&apos;s simplistic party vibes threatening to cave in the entire scene, Tom and Ed came to grips with what is -- compared to their previous work -- a house record. The pounding four-on-the-floor thump of tracks like &quot;Music:Response,&quot; &quot;Got Glint,&quot; and the duo&apos;s take on KLF-style stadium house for the single &quot;Hey Boy Hey Girl&quot; signals that this is a transition record for the Chemical Brothers, one that could eventually take them back into the straight-ahead dance mainstream status enjoyed by acts from Daft Punk to Armand Van Helden.&#xD;&#xA;The irony here is that even considering the changes, Surrender still feels very similar to its predecessors. The focus on wave-of-sound production, buckets full of old-school vocal samples, and various sirens and beatbox effects sound like they were lifted wholesale from their breakout album, Dig Your Own Hole, or their first release, Exit Planet Dust. And while a few of the vocal tracks focus on new collaborations, they&apos;re along the same lines, making it tough to spot the differences from past albums -- the quavering British vocals of Beth Orton have given way to the quavering American vocals of Hope Sandoval, and the Charlatans&apos; Tim Burgess is replaced by New Order&apos;s reclusive Bernard Sumner (a sure sign that the Chemicals have moved up a notch on the music-industry food chain). Also, two returning guests (Noel Gallagher and a member of Mercury Rev, here Jonathan Donahue) make very similar contributions to the record in the identical places they appeared on Dig Your Own Hole. Even besides its simpy title, the Gallagher track &quot;Let Forever Be&quot; is the very same electronica update of the Beatles&apos; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; that made their 1996 collaboration single &quot;Setting Sun&quot; a number one hit in Britain. And the Donahue track, &quot;Dream On,&quot; is very similar to the indie psychedelia of &quot;The Private Psychedelic Reel&quot; from Dig Your Own Hole. Sure, the Chemical Brothers do this type of music very well; it&apos;s just that Surrender isn&apos;t quite the change of direction they&apos;d been aiming for -- it&apos;s simply the same great album they&apos;d made two years earlier.

Try as they may, the bandmembers cannot deny the passage of time, or their geography, for Silversun Pickups are creatures of their time and place, just as their idols were. At their core, the Pumpkins were Midwestern misfits, something that was evident in their very appearance and sound. In contrast, Silversun Pickups shimmer sweetly on the surface, a sound suited for Los Angeles. Silversun Pickups avoid unpleasantness on Swoon, wallowing in washes of sound derived equally from guitars and whispered vocals and glimmering in the sunlight.

It’s this aesthetic that sets the band apart from the busier bands in post-rock and, really, rock in general. Doing more with less, the band continues to deliver rousing, lonely epics on its sixth album, Take Care, Take Care, Take Care. While the album features the quartet&apos;s reverb-heavy, guitar-oriented sound, there’s a definite shift in mood. Rather than a steady train of buildups and triumphant crescendos, Take Care has a warmer, more consoling feeling, acting like the soundtrack to the aftermath of some unknown event rather than the climax, bringing brightness to relive the emotional fallout. It feels as though Explosions in the Sky have developed an even greater sense of patience, allowing songs to build up more intricately without rushing their way into a huge moment of distortion-filled catharsis. This allows the album to build steadily in intensity over the course of its six tracks, with each song pushing the envelope further and further until the whole thing comes to a head in the closing track, “Let Me Back In,” giving the album a more cohesive feeling. More so than some of their earlier albums, Take Care, Take Care, Take Care can’t be skimmed or rushed, but instead requires the listener to let it unfold on its own terms, giving it time to flower and bloom when it’s ready. While this may not make it the most immediately exciting album of Explosions in the Sky&apos;s career, it easily stands to be one of their most rewarding. ~ Gregory Heaney" index="1" year="2011" thumb="/library/metadata/65437/thumb/1445628789" art="/library/metadata/65430/art/1445628090" parentThumb="/library/metadata/65430/thumb/1445628090" originallyAvailableAt="2011-01-01" leafCount="6" addedAt="1438446703" updatedAt="1445628789">

It&apos;s long on harmony and the kind of earnest, dual guitar riffing listeners have come to expect from young rockers raised on a diet of hardcore, Punk-O-Rama comps, and MTV. But Fall Out Boy really necks ahead of the pack behind the enormous voice of dreamboat-in-training lead singer Patrick Stump and lyrical content that merges musings on love and youth with healthy amounts of cutting cynicism, savvy popular culture touchstones, and cheeky phraseology. Though it was issued by Less Than Jake drummer Vinnie Fiorello&apos;s Fueled By Ramen imprint, a hefty advance from Island allowed Fall Out Boy to record Grave at Butch Vig&apos;s Smart Studios compound in Madison, WI, and employ the skills of producer Sean O&apos;Keefe, who&apos;d handled the boards for units like Lucky Boys Confusion and Motion City Soundtrack. Of course, Island will be looking for a substantial return on investment from Fall Out Boy. But before the band follows in the footsteps of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional -- which it deserves to and will -- listeners can enjoy Take This to Your Grave&apos;s undeniable mixture of exuberance and romantic hardcore. &#xD;&#xA;Like a high-school dreamer&apos;s homeroom notebook, Grave&apos;s margins are littered with impossibly clever turns of phrase. A preliminary scan of the record&apos;s song titles is enough to prove this. From the double-time hardcore of &quot;Reinventing the Wheel to Run Myself Over&quot; to the shifting dynamics of &quot;Homesick at Space Camp&quot; (which was seemingly engineered by NASA to incite a crowd singalong), Fall Out Boy renders each song with a different mix of talents. Every time you think you&apos;ve heard it all before, the band kills with another couplet. &quot;I know I&apos;m not your favorite record/The songs you grow to like never stick at first,&quot; Stump croons in &quot;Dead on Arrival.&quot; Later, &quot;Calm Before the Storm&quot; dissects a relationship with an almost intellectual mix of casual, MTV-generation reference-making and a dose of self-analysis that suggests sadcore anti-hero Bill Callahan. After name-checking a throwaway Top 40 ditty, Stump addresses his ex: &quot;What you do on your own time&apos;s just fine/My imagination&apos;s much worse.&quot; While Grave&apos;s 12 tracks run on the long-range external tanks of emotion that every teenager refuels with each miniature passing period drama, they&apos;re also professionally executed packets of melody. While the exposed nerve of hardcore is apparent throughout, Stump, bassist Peter Wentz, drummer Andrew Hurley, and guitarist Joseph Trohman are making music for a generation that appreciates a good hook, and isn&apos;t necessarily concerned where it comes from. Alternative, hip-hop, California skatepunk -- all the videos are directed the same way, and flannels, Fubu, and wallet chains are sometimes just set decorations. Fall Out Boy&apos;s positive is its honest intersection of pop&apos;s shallow nature with the rippling passion of hardcore. The band pulled all the frames of reference off the wall and built a larger one with the mismatched pieces. Inside it is Take This to Your Grave, a spectacular debut art project. ~ Johnny Loftus" index="1" year="2003" thumb="/library/metadata/57869/thumb/1445624399" art="/library/metadata/57868/art/1445624332" parentThumb="/library/metadata/57868/thumb/1445624332" originallyAvailableAt="2003-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438454897" updatedAt="1445624399">

Primal Scream gives &quot;Teardrop&quot; a barely recognizable noisy soundscape treatment betraying the commercially viable LP version at every turn. They drop the heartbeat drum track and let the mind wander with a collage of sound. Mad Professor doesn&apos;t go as far away from the groove of the LP version but gives the track two different dub treatments. The vocal mix is more cluttered and more aggressive compared to the instrumental that is airy and relaxed. Both are locked solidly in the groove, taking the LP version in entirely new directions. Surprisingly, Mad Professor&apos;s dub treatments on this single outshine almost any track on the Massive Attack vs. Mad Professor album. The single is capped off with a track that was not included on Mezzanine. &quot;Euro Zero Zero&quot; has Massive Attack embracing their hip-hop influences once again and creating a low-end masterpiece.

Thing is, most fans that held true during this time in the Zwan wilderness liked those indulgences (or at least came to expect them), so having the Pumpkins reduced to punishingly long guitar solos was disarming. In an act of over-corrective steering reminiscent of the left turn toward the thick, roiling Zeitgeist, Corgan responded to the criticisms of Zeitgeist by launching the absurdly ambitious Teargarden by Kaleidyscope project -- a conceptual 44-song suite to be doled out two songs at a time over the course of several years, initially available as free downloads, then gathered together as four-song EPs every few months. Based on the first of these, it’s apparent that Corgan has brought back the mysticism without sacrificing the six-string: the hardest moment, “Astral Planes” may carry some of his signature fuzztones, but it’s not a hard wall of distortion, it fits nicely with the slow, hazy crawl of “A Song for a Son,” the almost soft-rock-funk groove of “Widow Wake My Mind,” and the sprightly psychedelic pulse of “A Stitch in Time,” which does reflect Corgan’s unexpected dalliance with veterans from the Electric Prunes and Strawberry Alarm Clock. None of these songs have the concise punch of a single, but that’s surely intentional: they’re not designed as hooky statements of intent, they’re dreamy teasers for what promises to be Corgan’s most varied set of music since the days of Mellon Collie &amp; the Infinite Sadness, whose title is quite deliberately echoed in the very name of Teargarden by Kaleidyscope. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2010" thumb="/library/metadata/59928/thumb/1445625165" art="/library/metadata/59820/art/1445625014" parentThumb="/library/metadata/59820/thumb/1445625014" originallyAvailableAt="2010-01-01" leafCount="4" addedAt="1438448134" updatedAt="1445625165">

Of course, when it comes down to it, it’s a group of three natural-born collaborators: John Paul Jones, the old studio pro who gravitated toward provocative partners after Led Zeppelin’s demise, teaming up with R.E.M. as easily as he did with avant-queen Diamanda Galas and nu-folkster Sara Watkins; Dave Grohl, who hopped into an empty drummer’s chair whenever the opportunity presented itself; and Josh Homme, who set up a mini-empire based entirely on jam sessions. If Them Crooked Vultures brings to mind Homme’s projects more than Grohl&apos;s or Jones&apos;, it’s largely due to his role as lead vocalist and how guitar can push a rhythm section as powerful as this to the side, dominating with its grinding riffs and solos. Homme’s predilection for precision does reign supreme -- when the group stretches out, even wallowing in the murk on “Interlude with Ludes,” there’s the sense that, like a great improv troupe, the trio freaked out then retained the best moments, trimming away the indulgence and experiments, leaving behind intrinsically, grippingly musical hard rock, where power is secondary to interplay. And while there are melodies and hooks that certainly dig into the skull, what impresses is chemistry, how the three play together, how they instigate each other, and how they spur each other on, to the point where their familiar tropes sound fresh -- as on “Scumbug Blues,” where Jones’ “Trampled Underfoot” clavinet intertwines with Grohl’s avalanche and Homme’s rigorous psychedelia - creating guitar rock that’s at once classicist and adventurous and undeniably thrilling. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/62024/thumb/1445626343" art="/library/metadata/62023/art/1445625940" parentThumb="/library/metadata/62023/thumb/1445625940" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="13" addedAt="1438448434" updatedAt="1445626343">

A clear continuation of 2007’s Minutes to Midnight, A Thousand Suns also trades aggression for contemplation, burying the guitars under washes of chilly synthesizers -- a sound suited for a rap-metal band that no longer plays metal but hasn’t shaken off the angst, choosing to channel inward instead of outward. So few rap-metal bands have chosen to embrace their age -- they fight against it, deepening their technical chops while recycling ideas -- that it’s easy to admire Linkin Park’s decision not to shy away from it, even if their mega-success gives them the luxury to pursue musical risks. The problem is, the subdued rhythms, riffs, and raps of A Thousand Suns wind up monochromatic, an impression not erased by the brief bridges between songs, sampled speeches, and easy segues, every element retaining moodiness without offering distinction. Brooding is a better vehicle for angst than rage for a group whose members are well into their thirties, but an album created on a grayscale is less than compelling for anybody lacking the patience to squint and discern the minute details.

Instead of playing like refractions from a hall of mirrors, Alabama Shakes&apos; 2012 debut Boys &amp; Girls emphasizes how American roots music is now grounded in the &apos;60s notion of blues &amp; soul, all filtered through the prism of &apos;70s classic rock. And it&apos;s not just that Heath Fogg tears great, gnarled riffs out of his guitar while the rhythm section of Zac Cockrell and Steve Johnson hit the downbeat with a brutal force -- lead singer Brittany Howard phrases like a rock singer, playing up vocal affections with glee, ratcheting up the drama by laying hard into her elongated phrases. Which isn&apos;t to say Alabama Shakes ignores the straight stuff: much of Boys &amp; Girls is anchored in a Southern soul groove spliced from Stax and Muscle Shoals, the guitars of Fogg and Howard full and bold in their cleanly chopped rhythms, echoing the work of Steve Cropper and Jimmy Johnson. But Alabama Shakes aren&apos;t purists, they&apos;re modern -- they splice familiar sounds and forms together, then reshuffle them in subtly surprising ways. Unlike White or his Great Lakes cousins the Black Keys, Alabama Shakes aren&apos;t entirely enamored with what they can re-create in the studio -- they&apos;re too attached to the power of a live performance, making them an ideal candidate for a T-Bone Burnett or Joe Henry production somewhere down the road -- but they bear no special allegiance to the didactic needs of retro-rock. Their roots are just that -- roots, not anchors, allowing the group to grow, often in unexpected and quietly thrilling ways. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2011" thumb="/library/metadata/65290/thumb/1445628706" art="/library/metadata/65289/art/1445627881" parentThumb="/library/metadata/65289/thumb/1445627881" originallyAvailableAt="2011-01-01" leafCount="10" addedAt="1438446876" updatedAt="1445628706">

After listening to Tourist History, what the label heard in them becomes clear: Two Door Cinema Club craft immaculate pop that is infectious almost to a fault. On songs like their calling card “Something Good Can Work,” nimble guitars and drums -- both live and programmed -- propel yearning verses and big, hopeful choruses perfect for shouting along to. Alex Trimble’s boyish vocals recall Phoenix’s Thomas Mars and the Postal Service’s Ben Gibbard, and indeed, Two Door Cinema Club is just as adept as those bands are at fusing rock and electronic sounds into a smooth, sleek whole. Whether it’s the laser-like synths that ricochet through “Come Back Home”’s verses or streaking textures on “Do You Want It All?,” this hybrid never feels contrived or overcooked. And unlike some of their contemporaries, a unique urgency runs through Tourist History: even when trying to slow down, as on “Undercover Martyn,” the band gets carried away and the song picks up to Two Door Cinema Club’s usual brisk pace. For most of Tourist History, they stay on the right side of the fine line between consistency and monotony, and as the album unfolds, the band throws some curves into its almost scientifically perfect pop songs. “Cigarettes in the Theatre”’s trumpet solo harks back to the mid-‘80s heyday of sophisti-pop, while “I Can Talk”’s playfully sampled backing vocals show a wit that extends to lyrics like “Eat That Up, It’s Good for You”’s “You would look a little better/Don’t you know/If you just wore less makeup.” While Two Door Cinema Club don&apos;t yet have the flawless style or emotional weight of some of their influences, Tourist History just gets catchier and more stylized as it goes on, offering a promising foundation for the band to embellish with even more personality next time. ~ Heather Phares" index="1" year="2010" thumb="/library/metadata/61575/thumb/1445626214" art="/library/metadata/61574/art/1445625766" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61574/thumb/1445625766" originallyAvailableAt="2010-01-01" leafCount="10" addedAt="1438448615" updatedAt="1445626214">

Wilder kept his production lean and accessible, accentuating No Doubt&apos;s appealing mix of new wave melodicism, post-grunge rock, and West Coast sunshine. Even though the band isn&apos;t always able to fuse its edgy energy with pop melodies, the combination worked far better than anyone could have hoped. When everything does click, the record is pure fun, even if some of the album makes you wish they could sustain that energy throughout the record.

But the vocoder, which robbed Young&apos;s voice of its dynamics and phrasing, still kept the songs from being as moving as they were intended to be. And despite the crisp dance beats and synthesizers, the music sounded less like new Kraftwerk than like old Devo. A few more conventional Young songs (left over from an earlier rejected album) seemed out of place.

When it was announced that the duo would score the sequel to one of sci-fi&apos;s most visionary movies, it seemed like the perfect fit: Their sleek, neon-tipped, playful aesthetic springs from their love of late-&apos;70s and early-&apos;80s pop culture artifacts like Tron. However, Tron: Legacy takes a much darker, more serious approach than the original film and Daft Punk follows suit, delivering soaring and ominous pieces that sound more like modern classical music than any laser tag-meets-roller disco fantasies fans may have had. Tron: Legacy&apos;s legitimacy as a score may surprise listeners unaware of Bangalter&apos;s fine work on 2003&apos;s Irreversible; while that score actually hews closer to Daft Punk&apos;s sound, it showed his potential for crafting music beyond the duo&apos;s usual scope. Working with the London Orchestra, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo fuse electronic and orchestral motifs seamlessly and strikingly. &quot;The Game Has Changed&quot; may be the most dramatic example: It starts with a wistful wisp of melody that sounds like a ghost in the machine, then swells of strings and brass and buzzsaw electronics submerge but never quite overtake it. Elsewhere, &quot;Recognizer&quot;&apos;s pulsing horns and synths and &quot;The Son of Flynn&quot;&apos;s arpeggios and strings are so tightly knit that they finish each others&apos; phrases. Daft Punk get in a few clever nods to Wendy Carlos&apos; Tron score, from &quot;The Grid&quot;&apos;s blobby analog synth tones to &quot;Adagio for Tron&quot;&apos;s mournful sense of lost wonder. However, for most of Tron: Legacy, they&apos;re concerned with pushing boundaries. It&apos;s not until the score&apos;s second half that the duo&apos;s more typical sound emerges on &quot;Derezzed&quot;&apos;s filter-disco and on &quot;End of the Line,&quot; where witty 8-bit sounds evoke &apos;80s video games. These tracks come as welcome relief from the tension Daft Punk ratchets up on almost every other piece, particularly &quot;Rectifier&quot; and &quot;C.L.U.&quot; Encompassing the past, present, and future of sci-fi scores, Tron: Legacy feels like it grew and mutated from its origins the same way the film&apos;s world did.

She didn&apos;t have an easy-to-market image like Britney or Christina, nor were her singles all that distinctive, so it was a real shock when she reinvented herself as a badass dance-rock chick for her second album, M!ssundaztood. It wasn&apos;t just that the album revealed a unique, forceful personality; it was that it crafted an original, dynamic sound from seemingly contradictory sources, as Pink hauled out forgotten 4 Non Blondes leader Linda Perry for her primary collaborator, piled on the hard rock riffs, and sharpened up the R&amp;B rhythms, while writing as nakedly as a confessional singer/songwriter. It was a big surprise that Pink had an album like M!ssundaztood in her, but that surprise is nearly equaled by its successor, Try This, which proves that she can pull off the same trick twice -- an unpredictable giant leap forward, assisted by unlikely collaborators, that winds up being among the best pop music of its given year. While Perry is still around, she only collaborates on three tracks, since Pink has picked another left-field choice for her main co-writer/producer for Try This: Tim Armstrong, one of the lead singer/songwriters for the acclaimed neo-punk band Rancid. Armstrong co-writes and produces eight of the 13 songs here, and while it&apos;s true that he helps steer Pink into harder-rocking territory, the end result isn&apos;t quite as simple as Try This being a straight-up rock &amp; roll album. Instead, hard rock is used as the foundation for the record (even some of the Perry-written tracks rock very hard), and then it stretches out into several different styles and sounds. Some are familiar -- there&apos;s a handful of dance-oriented tracks, a quiet ballad, such as the closer, &quot;Love Song&quot; -- but, like M!ssundaztood, this is pop music that knows no boundaries, borrowing ideas from punk, soul, ska, new wave, and electronica to create an exhilarating listen that crackles with energy and inventiveness. This music has reference points, some intentional and some not -- the similarities of &quot;Trouble&quot; and Nirvana&apos;s cover of the Vaselines&apos; &quot;Molly&apos;s Lips&quot; may be on purpose, but the echoes of Blur&apos;s &quot;Pressure on Julian&quot; on &quot;God Is a DJ&quot; is surely coincidental -- but it&apos;s presentation is original and exceptionally well-written. This time around, she&apos;s not as consciously confessional, which makes for a nice fit for Armstrong&apos;s strong sense of songcraft and pop hooks, resulting in music that is immediately grabbing yet so sturdily crafted it only seems stronger, even catchier, with repeated listens. While Pink&apos;s peers take incremental, cautious artistic steps forward, she&apos;s slyly fearless, choosing the right collaborators that help her create pop music that has both style and substance to spare. Britney Spears, Pink&apos;s avowed arch-nemesis, may claim that she&apos;s taking advice from Madonna, but here Pink illustrates that she&apos;s the true heir to Madonna&apos;s throne, since she displays a restlessness similar to the Material Girl in the &apos;80s, while never once sounding like Madonna -- or other spiritual predecessors like Pat Benatar, Stevie Nicks, or Debbie Harry, for that matter. With Try This, Pink has firmly established a voice of her own, and in doing so, she&apos;s made another tremendous modern pop record.

The Gabriel set was released in 1998, but instead of a second box following it in 1999, the single-disc Turn It on Again: The Hits appeared. Truth be told, it was a wise move, because even if the Collins set appears, there will be a market for a concise collection of hits, which Turn It on Again more or less is. Since Genesis had such a prolific career and had so many hits, it should come as no surprise that the compilation isn&apos;t complete, but it&apos;s a little disappointing to discover that such latter-day non-entities as &quot;Hold on My Heart&quot; (from the last Collins album, We Can&apos;t Dance) and &quot;Congo&quot; (from the post-Collins album, Calling All Stations) are included in favor of such fine singles as &quot;Paperlate&quot; or &quot;Man on the Corner.&quot; But that&apos;s nitpicking, since all the big hits are here: &quot;Turn It on Again,&quot; &quot;Invisible Touch,&quot; &quot;Follow You, Follow Me,&quot; &quot;Tonight, Tonight, Tonight,&quot; &quot;In Too Deep,&quot; &quot;That&apos;s All,&quot; &quot;Misunderstanding,&quot; &quot;Throwing It All Away,&quot; and the list goes on and on. True, the sublime Gabriel number &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; sounds completely out of place sandwiched between &quot;Abacab&quot; and &quot;No Son of Mine,&quot; but it&apos;s nice to have it here. Similarly, &quot;The Carpet Crawlers 1999,&quot; reworked as a duet between Collins and Gabriel, is a surprisingly effective re-recording, and a nice inclusion. It may not be enough to convince hardcore fans that they need Turn It on Again, but this album is really for listeners who&apos;ve thought of Genesis as a singles act, and they&apos;re not going to be disappointed by this. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1999" thumb="/library/metadata/63628/thumb/1445627122" art="/library/metadata/63627/art/1445626647" parentThumb="/library/metadata/63627/thumb/1445626647" originallyAvailableAt="1999-01-01" leafCount="18" addedAt="1438453142" updatedAt="1445627122">

Several years before this debut&apos;s release, the Feeling were little more than a ski lodge cover band, serenading Swiss snow boarders with Top 40 hits in exchange for lodging and chump change. Assimilating the tricks of the trade paid off, however, and Home&apos;s 12 tracks brim with delightfully appropriated moves: a pumping piano riff from Supertramp (&quot;Fill My Little World&quot;), swells of harmonies à la the Bangles (&quot;Love It When You Call&quot;), a zany chord progression straight out of the Beatles&apos; druggiest days (&quot;Helicopter&quot;). The quintet knows its strengths and caters to them at every turn, letting frontman Dan Gillespie-Sells helm a handful of ballads (his delivery is impeccable, especially on the bittersweet British megahit &quot;Sewn&quot;) and showcasing the Feeling&apos;s biggest asset, harmony vocals. They stack their voices like a bubblegum version of Queen, mirroring each other&apos;s sighs and crescendos, even halting the music altogether for a few measures of polyphonic a cappella. The latter move is especially effective on &quot;Fill My Little World,&quot; where a Merseybeat-styled chorus is smartly contrasted by a sobering vocals-only outro. This brand of bold-faced classicist pop is a tricky thing to pull off -- especially in the wake of semi-jokesters the Darkness, who excelled in their craft while simultaneously making a mockery of it -- but the Feeling have the chic (and perhaps the cheek) to do so successfully.

Like most arty collegiate types, she reacted to massive success with an instinct to experiment, and since she had sold so many records, she and producer/collaborator Glen Ballard were given free range to do pretty much whatever they wanted, resulting in a muted, fitfully intriguing album that had the feel of a sophomore slump even if it was her fourth record (but who counts those first two records as part of her discography, anyway?). It was pretty good, it sold pretty well, but nobody liked it all that much, so it was time for a cool change on her next record, Under Rug Swept (funny how the three years separating Jagged Little Pill and Supposed seemed longer than the three between Supposed and this). The biggest move Alanis made was ditching Ballard, which has the unexpected result of bringing back the sound of Jagged Little Pill, a lush, dense layering of loops, guitars, keyboards, and vocals that makes her songs seem catchier than they are. But that&apos;s not all -- she&apos;s returned to the impassioned, awkwardly written, syllable-heavy confessional verse that marked Jagged Little Pill. Not only that, she&apos;s returned to the very relationship that inspired her breakthrough hit &quot;You Oughta Know,&quot; most clearly on the album&apos;s lead single, &quot;Hands Clean,&quot; this time written from the perspective of the older man who laid prey to the young Canadian star. This would all seem calculated, an attempt to regain her chart status, if Morissette wasn&apos;t so unabashedly earnest, seemingly unembarrassed by her confessions. And perhaps she shouldn&apos;t be, since her lyrics are so elaborately overwritten it&apos;s hard to discern what&apos;s going on in her songs. Repeated listens may reveal that her tortured verse derives from something very personal indeed (perhaps it&apos;s something so personal, she chooses to hide it by ignoring the rules of syntax and logic, but given her interviews, her unwieldy words are likely just a personal artistic statement), but it&apos;s never clear what the songs are about, unless she makes it clear in the title (&quot;21 Things I Want in a Lover,&quot; &quot;Narcissus,&quot; to name but two). It was easier to call this trait charming on the diary confessions of Jagged, but by this point, the elaborate phrasing and rush of consonants is becoming a bit of a distraction, but the saving grace of Under Rug Swept is that it sounds good. The music flows, the production doesn&apos;t overplay its hand, it&apos;s pleasingly melodic, tempering the extremities of Jagged Little Pill while retaining the character, and as such, it&apos;s easy to groove on the sound without listening to the words. A downside is that the songs, apart from the first three, don&apos;t stand out as individual songs, but they do cohere as a whole better than Supposed, and that&apos;s no small accomplishment. Alanis is still held back by her own idiosyncrasies -- her determination to be different, to write every word she could possibly ever want to say in as difficult a way as possible -- but that&apos;s also her defining characteristic. It&apos;s better heard on Jagged, but if you want more of that, take this: it&apos;s what Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie should have been. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="2002" thumb="/library/metadata/58171/thumb/1445624519" art="/library/metadata/58170/art/1445624486" parentThumb="/library/metadata/58170/thumb/1445624486" originallyAvailableAt="2002-01-01" leafCount="11" addedAt="1438453694" updatedAt="1445624519">

Hit singles such as &quot;Somewhere Only We Know,&quot; &quot;Bedshaped,&quot; and &quot;Everything&apos;s Changing&quot; made Hopes and Fears a transatlantic hit, earning the trio two Brit Awards, a Grammy nomination, and a host of sold-out world tours. They&apos;re as likeable and as accessible as Coldplay yet Keane&apos;s return isn&apos;t as buoyant as their initial introduction. Whereas Hopes and Fears faced uncertainty head on with joyous enthusiasm, Under the Iron Sea is a darker, less romantic set of songs affected by a disenchanted outlook on life and the world&apos;s problems. Keane feels the frustration of a world torn apart by war, but also expresses their own growing pains as a group. Songs such as the grayish ebb and flow of &quot;A Bad Dream&quot; and &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; connect with such reflections. Frontman Tom Chaplin faces the disappointment of growing older on the haunting &quot;Atlantic,&quot; another stone-cold gem of synthesizer strings and Tim Rice-Oxley&apos;s gorgeous piano delivery. When you think it might be totally depressing, there are some hints of life hidden in the corners of Under the Iron Sea and these mysterious loops highlight Keane&apos;s new sonic experiments. Thus far they&apos;ve existed without guitars. Though the bounty of this record breathes with a collection of various analog synths and an old electric piano, Rice-Oxley&apos;s usual performance is now enhanced with a bevy of guitar effect pedals. Debut single &quot;It Is Any Wonder?&quot; is layered with pianos and Chaplin cries out, &quot;Stranded in the wrong time/Where love is just a lyric in a children&apos;s rhyme, a soundbite.&quot; Such words capture how crucial it was for Keane to come up with something that&apos;s tangible and thought-provoking, but the guitar pedals are just a bit too dramatic. Keane should be applauded for going after a different sound; there&apos;s no harm in that, but die-hard fans might rush to judge Under the Iron Sea as sounding a bit too much like U2.

Being a woman, she&apos;s always in question of her actions, calling out and interrogating the opposite sex for her own pleasure. But it&apos;s not necessarily with a scolding tone. She&apos;s playful with her signature piano accompaniment, but allows for a twisted mess of guitars, violins, and bass loops, which are quite enigmatic like Kate Bush as well. &quot;Baker Baker&quot; and &quot;Bells for Her&quot; are aching with ballad-esque beauty, but the seething &quot;The Waitress&quot; sparks Amos&apos; inner devil. She&apos;s quaint at first, but rages into a scalding vocal queen. It makes her even more a pioneer for female originality and independence. Singles such as &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; are sultry and provocative, depicting that she&apos;s everything but shy. Under the Pink is typically melodic, but it contains a heavy desire. Amos is still breaking into something more definitive as both a woman and a singer/songwriter.

However, smooth as Morrison sounds, for much of the album there&apos;s a distinct lack of passion in his voice -- and that&apos;s a prime ingredient of real soul music. Only on &quot;Call the Police&quot; does he summon any real anguish. &quot;You Give Me Something,&quot; his first British hit, is catchy and memorable, but not a classic. Indeed, this is an album without soul classics. Ultimately it&apos;s more a piece of pop, but there&apos;s nothing wrong with that.

This one covers mostly early-&apos;90s material, centering on songs recorded around Love&apos;s Secret Domain, but it also includes some rare tracks dating back to the mid-&apos;80s. &quot;First Dark Ride&quot; and &quot;Baby Food&quot; are excellent long-form explorations into sound sculpture, not resembling &quot;songs&quot; per se, but atmospheres and textures. These are followed by the intriguing &quot;Music for Commercials,&quot; 11 bits of incidental music used in adverts for products like natural gas, accident insurance, perfume, and analgesics. Peter Christopherson&apos;s background in commercial video production and album design probably played a hand in getting the work. Coil transcend any accusations of &quot;selling out&quot; by creating music that still has their imprimatur on it, but work in a commercial setting. Very unique and unlike anything else in the Coil catalog. Also included is &quot;Feeder,&quot; collaboration with Chris &amp; Cosey. One of the more creepy songs on the album, a solo piano and cello begin the piece but are buried under a wall of noisy dub effects and John Balance&apos;s unearthly vocals, only to re-appear playing a twisted slow waltz. In Coil&apos;s extensive discography, this is a standout, but probably not the best place for neophytes, who would be better served by Love&apos;s Secret Domain or Stolen and Contaminated Songs. ~ James Mason" index="1" year="1997" thumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" art="/library/metadata/61395/art/1445625678" parentThumb="/library/metadata/61395/thumb/1445625678" originallyAvailableAt="1997-01-01" leafCount="10" addedAt="1438446286" updatedAt="1445628569">

It looked like the band had ended before reaching its full potential, which is part of the reason why their third album, Urban Hymns -- recorded after the pair patched things up in late 1996 -- is so remarkable. Much of the record consists of songs Ashcroft had intended for a solo project or a new group, yet Urban Hymns unmistakably sounds like the work of a full band, with its sweeping, grandiose soundscapes and sense of purpose. The Verve have toned down their trancy, psychedelic excursions, yet haven&apos;t abandoned them -- if anything, they sound more muscular than before, whether it&apos;s the trippy &quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot; or the pounding &quot;Come On.&quot; These powerful, guitar-drenched rockers provide the context for Ashcroft&apos;s affecting, string-laden ballads, which give Urban Hymns its hurt. The majestic &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; and the heartbreaking, country-tinged &quot;The Drugs Don&apos;t Work&quot; are an astonishing pair, two anthemic ballads that make the personal universal, thereby sounding like instant classics. They just are the tip of the iceberg -- &quot;Sonnet&quot; is a lovely, surprisingly understated ballad, &quot;The Rolling People&quot; has a measured, electric power, and many others match their quality. Although it may run a bit too long for some tastes, Urban Hymns is a rich album that revitalizes rock traditions without ever seeming less than contemporary. It is the album the Verve have been striving to make since their formation, and it turns out to be worth all the wait. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" year="1997" thumb="/library/metadata/60748/thumb/1445625672" art="/library/metadata/60747/art/1445625369" parentThumb="/library/metadata/60747/thumb/1445625369" originallyAvailableAt="1997-01-01" leafCount="13" addedAt="1438455291" updatedAt="1445625672">

This time, the material is divvied between two discs: a disc of their 18 best tracks and a second disc of B-sides and rarities. The main problem here is that the set doesn&apos;t seem aimed at any particular audience. The B-sides are targeted to hardcore fans who surely own the songs on the first disc already, and any newcomers will probably be scared away by the severity of the rarities. If you are indeed new to the Faith No More world, your best bet is to pick up the band&apos;s first two albums with Mike Patton, (The Real Thing and Angel Dust) for a starting point. For those newcomers looking for a loose chronological history of the group, with songs by the first vocalist Chuck Mosley and a spattering of covers (which are usually great), the Platinum Collection, This Is It: The Best of Faith No More, and Who Cares a Lot: Greatest Hits provide a slightly better overview at a more affordable price. ~ Jason Lymangrover" index="1" year="2009" thumb="/library/metadata/65401/thumb/1445628779" art="/library/metadata/65400/art/1445628088" parentThumb="/library/metadata/65400/thumb/1445628088" originallyAvailableAt="2009-01-01" leafCount="28" addedAt="1438446732" updatedAt="1445628779">

The first level is that of a young, almost compelling, singer/songwriter. Mraz has a nice voice, perhaps a little too articulated at times, which manages to mostly avoid the histrionic despite a predilection towards show tuney melodic turns. His voice tumbles out on top of folk-reggae rhythms that will probably sound a bit dated with time, but his vocals are filled with enough internal rhythms and rhymes to keep them interesting. Lyrically, Mraz relies on cliché to a certain degree, but does so with an earnestness that allows for believability and an eye for imagery that succeeds often enough to suggest that he knows what he&apos;s doing. The second level of Waiting for My Rocket to Come is the production of John Alagía, whose work has enhanced other similar folk-pop fair, including the Dave Matthews Band and O.A.R. His work with Mraz is, at its best, transparent, filling out the songs with subtle and glossy production and instrumentation. Reflections of banjos, organs, mellotrons, lap steels, ukuleles, and others peak out through the shine of the tunes, creating an impact too rich to be written off as lite. ~ Jesse Jarnow" index="1" year="2004" thumb="/library/metadata/65116/thumb/1445628668" art="/library/metadata/65115/art/1445627771" parentThumb="/library/metadata/65115/thumb/1445627771" originallyAvailableAt="2004-01-01" leafCount="12" addedAt="1438446961" updatedAt="1445628668">

Because throughout their debut album, We Don&apos;t Need to Whisper, he relies on sounds and textures borrowed from 1988, the era when college rock was filled with atmospheric sonics and earnest politics. Specifically, he layers delayed guitars ripped from U2 over soundscapes equally inspired by the Cure, New Order, Peter Gabriel, and The Unforgettable Fire, all in an attempt to fashion a modern-day protest record. Lord knows it&apos;s an admirable break from his juvenile past, but good intentions don&apos;t necessarily make for good music, as We Don&apos;t Need to Whisper makes abundantly clear. DeLonge&apos;s main problem is that by relying on &apos;80s college rock as his template, he&apos;s fallen into a lot of traps that have made albums of that era sound hopelessly dated: overlong intros, lasting upward of 90 seconds; formless songs that never seem to peak, only drift; cold keyboards that work a factory preset too heavily; an over-reliance on delay pedals, not just on the guitars (which never once sound like anybody other than the Edge), but on the keyboards, which has the unfortunate side effect of making the somber &quot;Distraction&quot; sound like an homage to Paul McCartney&apos;s gleefully moronic &quot;Wonderful Christmas Time.&quot; That&apos;s not the only unintentional chuckle here -- DeLonge&apos;s thin, nasal voice cuts against the moody murk of his band, as if he were a little kid recording over his big brother&apos;s music. It also doesn&apos;t help that his screeds about war, society, and life are overly written, with words piling on top of each other in free-form song structures that tend to collapse under the weight of his ambition. Since DeLonge was starting to edge toward an interesting fusion of dark post-punk, tuneful pop-punk, and mature concerns on the last blink-182 album, such an over-reach is a disappointment, but it is understandable; it&apos;s a classic case of post-breakup indulgence. It may not make for a successful record, but it does make for an interesting one, particularly in how DeLonge&apos;s desire to be taken seriously has led him to use the serious music of his adolescence as a signifier that he&apos;s serious now, but We Don&apos;t Need to Whisper is too doggedly dour and amorphous to be more than a curiosity.

West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum is more demented than outsized, however, replacing the ego rock of Empire with a barmy blend of electronics, acoustics, thriller movie ambience, and industrial psychedelia. Producer Dan the Automator also adds touches of hip-hop to the mix, highlighting the band&apos;s rhythmic base by stripping back the layers of guitar and sampled synth. The result is an interesting, unexpected piece of work, devoid of a militantly commercial single like Empire&apos;s self-titled track, and lacking the shaggy Madchester vibes that Christopher Karloff brought to 2004&apos;s Kasabian. If the band&apos;s eponymous debut was the soundtrack to a drug-filled night in England&apos;s trendiest club, then West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum is the soundtrack to the ensuing walk home, when that club has kicked out its last patrons and the streets are dark and forbidding. There&apos;s enough psychedelia here to partially thwart the shadowy electronics -- for every &quot;Vlad the Impaler,&quot; there&apos;s a trippy counterpart like &quot;Secret Alphabets&quot; - and Kasabian often augments the new approach with old habits, such as the dance-rock chorus that bisects the anxious, minimalist shuffle of &quot;Fire.&quot; The bulk of West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum canvasses unfamiliar territory, however, a wise move for a group that&apos;s routinely struggled to escape the shadow of its influences.

While it may share several similarities with its predecessor -- there is an equal ratio of covers-to-originals, a familiar blend of girl group, Motown, R&amp;B, pop, and rock, and a show tune that interrupts the flow of the album -- With the Beatles is a better record that not only rocks harder, it&apos;s considerably more sophisticated. They could deliver rock &amp; roll straight (&quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;) or twist it around with a little Latin lilt (&quot;Little Child,&quot; one of their most underrated early rockers); Lennon and McCartney wrote sweet ballads (the achingly gorgeous &quot;All I&apos;ve Got to Do&quot;) and sprightly pop/rockers (&quot;All My Loving&quot;) with equal aplomb; and the propulsive rockers (&quot;It Won&apos;t Be Long&quot;) were as richly melodic as slower songs (&quot;Not a Second Time&quot;). Even George Harrison&apos;s first recorded song, &quot;Don&apos;t Bother Me,&quot; is a standout, with its wonderfully foreboding minor-key melody. Since the Beatles covered so much ground with their originals, their covers pale slightly in comparison, particularly since they rely on familiar hits (only &quot;Devil in Her Heart&quot; qualifies as a forgotten gem). But for every &quot;Roll Over Beethoven,&quot; a surprisingly stiff reading of the Chuck Berry standard, there is a sublime moment, such as Lennon&apos;s soaring interpretation of &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me,&quot; and the group always turns in thoroughly enjoyable performances. Still, the heart of With the Beatles lies not in the covers, but the originals, where it was clear that, even at this early stage, the Beatles were rapidly maturing and changing, turning into expert craftsmen and musical innovators.

The two opening songs, the bopping &quot;Lisztomania&quot; and the buzzing &quot;1901,&quot; are so immediate and prone to habitual play that the remainder of the album is bound to be neglected. There is plenty to like beyond that point, including &quot;Lasso,&quot; which niftily alternates between a tangled rhythm and tight-spiral riffing, and the labyrinthine &quot;Pt. 1&quot; of &quot;Love Like a Sunset,&quot; which serves the same purpose as the extended instrumental passages on Roxy Music&apos;s Avalon, at least until its rousing conclusion and shift into &quot;Pt. 2.&quot; Beyond containing the band&apos;s best, most efficient songwriting, the album also stands apart from the first three studio albums by projecting a cool punch that is unforced.

In early 2001, the Chicago-area band focused on recording their fourth album, which ultimately led to the departure of guitarist Jay Bennett and tensions with their record label. Unwilling to change the album to make it more commercially viable, the band bought the finished studio tapes from Warner/Reprise for 50,000 dollars and left the label altogether. The turmoil surrounding the recording and distribution of the album in no way diminishes the sheer quality of the genre-spanning pop songs written by frontman Jeff Tweedy and his bandmates. After throwing off the limiting shackles of the alt-country tag that they had been saddled with through their 1996 double album Being There, Wilco experimented heavily with the elaborate constructs surrounding their simple melodies on Summerteeth. The long-anticipated Yankee Hotel Foxtrot continues their genre-jumping and worthwhile experimentation. The sprawling, nonsensical &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot; is as charmingly bleak as anything Tweedy has written to date, while the positively joyous &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; jangles through bright choruses and summery reminiscences. Similarly, &quot;Kamera&quot; dispels the opening track&apos;s gray with a warm acoustic guitar and mixer/multi-instrumentalist/&quot;fifth Beatle&quot; Jim O&apos;Rourke&apos;s unusual production. The true high points of the album are when the songwriting is at its most introspective, as it is during the heartwrenching &quot;Ashes of American Flags,&quot; which takes on an eerie poignancy in the wake of the attacks at the World Trade Center. &quot;All my lies are always wishes,&quot; Tweedy sings, &quot;I know I would die if I could come back new.&quot; As is the case with many great artists, the evolution of the band can push the music into places that many listeners (and record companies for that matter) may not be comfortable with, but, in the case of Wilco, their growth has steadily led them into more progressive territory. While their songs still maintain the loose intimacy that was apparent on their debut A.M., the music has matured to reveal a complexity that is rare in pop music, yet showcased perfectly on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.

(The rest of the album was filled out with &quot;Yellow Submarine,&quot; &quot;All You Need Is Love,&quot; and a George Martin score.) What&apos;s more, two of the four new tracks were little more than pleasant throwaways that had been recorded during 1967 and early 1968. These aren&apos;t all that bad; &quot;All Together Now&quot; is a cute, kiddieish McCartney singalong, while &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot; has some mild Lennon nastiness and a great beat and central piano riff, with some fine playing all around -- each is memorable in its way, and the inclusion of the Lennon song here was all the more important, as the sequence from the movie itself in which it was used was deleted from the original U.S. release of the movie (which had no success whatever in the U.K. and quickly disappeared, thus making the U.S. version the established cut of the film for decades, until the late-&apos;90s restoration and DVD re-release of the movie). George Harrison&apos;s two contributions were the more striking of the new entries -- &quot;Only a Northern Song,&quot; a leftover from the Sgt. Pepper&apos;s sessions, generated from a period in which the guitarist became increasingly fascinated with keyboards, especially the organ and the Mellotron (and, later, the synthesizer), and is an odd piece of psychedelic ersatz, mixing trippiness and some personal comments; its lyrics (and title) on the one hand express the guitarist/singer/composer&apos;s displeasure at being tied in his publishing to Northern Songs, a company in which John Lennon and Paul McCartney were the majority shareholders; and, on the other, they present Harrison&apos;s vision of how music and recording sounded, from the inside out and the outside in, during the psychedelic era -- the song thus provided a rare glimpse inside the doors of perception of being a Beatle (or, at least, one aspect of being this particular Beatle) circa 1967. And then there was the jewel of the new songs, &quot;It&apos;s All Too Much&quot;; coming from the second half of 1967, the song -- resplendent in swirling Mellotron, larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar -- was a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia, that was actually superior in some respects to &quot;Blue Jay Way,&quot; Harrison&apos;s songwriting contribution of The Magical Mystery Tour; the song also later rated a dazzling cover by Steve Hillage in the middle of the following decade. The very fact that George Harrison was afforded two song slots and a relatively uncompetitive canvas for his music shows how little the project meant to Lennon and McCartney -- as did the cutting of the &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot; sequence from the movie, apparently with no resistance from Lennon, who had other, more important artistic fish to fry in 1968. What is here, however, is a good enough reason for owning the record, though nothing rates it as anything near a high-priority purchase. &#xD;&#xA;The album would have been far better value if it had been released as a four-song EP (an idea the Beatles even considered at one point, with the addition of a bonus track in &quot;Across the Universe&quot; but ultimately discarded). And the original soundtrack was partly supplanted by the release at the end of the &apos;90s of the Yellow Submarine (Songtrack), which marked the first of the remastered Beatles albums, thus reducing the appeal of the original. No one would argue that there&apos;s a huge amount more than meets the eye (or ear) there, but listening to the original album anew 40 years on, one is still struck by how mostly second-rate, and recycled and rejected Beatles material still sounds so good. And while George Martin&apos;s instrumental music from the film wasn&apos;t what a lot of Beatles fans were looking for, it was relegated safely to side two if one wished to ignore it. And even that material offered a pleasant surprise or two -- first, over how much more enjoyable it was than the Ken Thorne-arranged background music for Help! (could one imagine a full side of that on an album?); and, second, the fun that Martin has as an orchestrator with some of George Harrison&apos;s recent Hindustanti music excursions on &quot;Sea of Time&quot;; the latter is doubly interesting, as Martin in later years, in his autobiography All You Need Is Ears, admitted to regretting some of the antipathy he showed to Harrison and his music and songwriting during their time together with the Beatles. And, finally, as a Beatles-lite release, Yellow Submarine does have its moments of welcome on the turntable or the CD player -- it&apos;s not every time that calls for listening as ambitious and demanding as The White Album, Abbey Road, or Sgt. Pepper&apos;s.
